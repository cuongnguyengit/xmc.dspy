ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare, often fatal complication of labor and delivery. The classic presentation is the sudden onset of a triad of clinical manifestations: hypoxia, hypotension and coagulopathy. Understanding of the syndrome as an immunologically mediated, complicated and often catastrophic maternal response to fetal or placental antigens is coming into focus. New treatments such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and better use of old treatments such as transfusion offer hope, but the condition is often rapidly fatal, so saving the maternal and fetal lives depends on rapid recognition of the syndrome. This series of three cases illustrates the clinical features enabling the rapid recognition needed for successful treatment of amniotic fluid embolism syndrome. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Labor and delivery have the potential to become a critical experience for mother and baby. The obstetrician must always be on high alert for the rare emergency. Sudden cardiovascular collapse during labor and delivery can be due to pulmonary thromboembolism, hemorrhage, venous air embolism, anaphylaxis, high cephalad spread of epidural anesthesia, peripartum cardiomyopathy, eclampsia or amniotic fluid embolism.1 Among these complications, amniotic fluid embolism remains one of the most feared because of its suddenness, severity and frequently fatal outcome. Emerging life-saving treatments for amniotic fluid embolism make it more promising to successfully treat this life-threatening cause of cardiovascular collapse during labor and delivery. This series of three cases is reported in detail to highlight the variability in presentation and provide a didactic review to encourage rapid recognition and intervention. CASE 1 This 35-year-old mother of two was admitted to an urban hospital in the Midwest USA at 37 4/7 weeks gestation at 09:21 with spontaneous rupture of membranes since 04:00. She was having irregular mild contractions. Group B Streptococcus had been isolated. Her outpatient medications included only salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler for asthma, and prenatal vitamins. The patient's temperature was 36.3o C, pulse 86/minute, blood pressure 135/85 mm Hg and respirations 20/minute. Fetal heart rate was normal at 120-130/minute. At 10:15 the patient's hemoglobin was 11.6 g/dL. (RR: 11.7-15.7 g/dL). An intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer's solution was started, and the patient received prophylactic penicillin. Oxytocin augmentation was started. A total of 24 MU of oxytocin was given from 13:30 to 18:15. Labor proceeded uneventfully, with the cervix dilated to 5 cm, until about nine hours after admission.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597033.076599}
