ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Procalcitonin (PCT) is used as a biomarker for identifying the occurrence of sepsis. Previous studies have reported high levels of PCT with acetaminophen intoxication without evidence of infection. Here, we report two patients with acetaminophen intoxication with high levels of PCT without showing any symptoms of bacterial infection. This case study examined two unrelated patients with acetaminophen intoxication admitted to emergency at different times. The first patient was admitted to the emergency department after ingesting approximately 8000 mg (153.8 mg/kg) of acetaminophen. On admission, C-reactive protein (CRP), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were normal. PCT and acetaminophen levels were 31.89 ng/mL and below 0.5 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The second patient was admitted to the emergency department 8 h after ingesting \u223c23,600 mg (280.6 mg/kg) of acetaminophen. By the second day of admission, GOT and GPT increased to 2508 and 1473 IU/L, respectively. PCT was 45.66 ng/mL with acetaminophen level at 116.9 \u03bcg/mL. Both patients were clear of symptoms associated with bacterial infection. METHODS Acetaminophen intoxication. METHODS N-acetylcysteine was given intravenously to both patients for 20 h per protocol. RESULTS Both patients were discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS Observations suggests that elevated levels of PCT in patients intoxicated with acetaminophen may be associated with involvement of other organs impacted by cytokine stimuli from sterile inflammation resulting from hepatic damage rather than PCT secretion directly caused by hepatic cell damage. TEXT: 1 Introduction Procalcitonin (PCT) is used as an effective biomarker in identifying sepsis as well as to help determine the duration of antibiotics used in a patient.[1\u20135] However, recent studies have shown that bacterial infection may not be the only cause resulting in elevated PCT levels. PCT levels can be elevated in patients experiencing acute liver failure (ALF) associated with acetaminophen intoxication without infection.[5\u20137] This demonstrates that a measure of PCT does not always correlate with the probability of infection.[5\u20137] One study has documented extremely elevated levels of PCT in children with ALF due to acetaminophen intoxication without evidence of bacterial infection that could not be explained by drug induced liver cell injury and/or hidden bacterial infection.[5] Although the exact mechanisms of increased PCT levels in acetaminophen intoxication were unclear, the results of these previous studies suggest that high PCT levels in acetaminophen intoxication might be associated with involvement of other organs affected by cytokine stimuli in addition to liver cell damage.[5\u20137]\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596090.3690028}
