ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Entecavir (ETV) is widely used in the treatment of hepatitis B, but there are only a few reports about entecavir-associated thrombocytopenia, and it is considered as an immediate response and inappropriate to continue the treatment with other nucleoside analogues. Now, we report the third case, and this case was delayed response and we switched to treatment with tenofovir (TDF). There was a 66-year-old female who was infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Her platelet count decreased from 111*109/L to 3*109/L and was prone to gum bleeding and skin ecchymosis after she received ETV treatment for 88 days. As a treatment option, ETV was replaced by TDF immediately, frequent platelets transfusions and thrombopoietin were applied for several days, daily prednisone of 50 mg was concomitantly taken, and then platelet count improved after 10 days. She was diagnosed with entecavir-associated thrombocytopenia after analysis of the temporal relationship and exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia by blood and bone marrow examinations. Our case suggested that the platelet count should be monitored regularly in patients during ETV treatment, and it may be a feasible option to choose TDF to maintain antiviral treatment when entecavir-associated thrombocytopenia occurs. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Many people infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and for the development of chronic hepatitis B (CHB), hepatitis Bassociated liver cirrhosis (HBV-LC) or hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC) in China. 1 The only effective method to block the progression is antiviral therapy, and entecavir (ETV) is a first-line drug for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, which has been used for decades and proven to have slight side effects and good tolerance. In rare cases, ETV would be associated with severe thrombocytopenia, there are two case reports of entecavir-associated thrombocytopenia, and it is considered as an immediate response and inappropriate to continue the treatment with nucleoside analogues.2,3 Here, we report the third case of a female who developed severe thrombocytopenia with bleeding after she had received entecavir for 88 days, and switched to treatment with tenofovir.
