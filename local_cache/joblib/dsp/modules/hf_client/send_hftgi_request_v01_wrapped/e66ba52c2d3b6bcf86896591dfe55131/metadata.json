ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: We report our experience with needlescopic splenectomy (NS) for the surgical treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura using a 3-mm needlescope with three ports. One patient was male and two were females, and their mean age was 58 years. The patient was placed in the right lateral decubitus position. The first 12-mm port was introduced through the lateral margin of the left rectus abdominis muscle, and the other two 3-mm ports were inserted in the left upper quadrant. NS was performed by a standard technique under the observation of 3.3-mm needlescope. The surgical procedure was successfully completed in all the patients. The mean duration of surgery, intra-operative bleeding volume and post-operative hospital stay were 176 min, 70 ml and 4.7 days, respectively. There were no particular peri-operative complications in spite of dense adhesions or simultaneous laparoscopic procedures. Our method is safe and feasible with low morbidity and without impairing cosmetic benefits. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A laparoscopic approach is often used for the surgical treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) to improve the cosmetic result and post-operative quality of life of the patients. Furthermore, needlescopic splenectomy (NS) [1] has developed as a result of advancements in minimally invasive surgery. However, 2-mm needlescopic procedures have not been widely adopted because of some instrument features such as easy bending of the shaft, poor scope visualization and weak manipulation [2]. Therefore, we introduced 3-mm needlescopic devices to perform laparoscopic splenectomy. The indications for which the patients underwent splenectomy included no response to medical therapy, discontinuation of corticosteroid due to adverse effects, planning for pregnancy and absence of splenomegaly. Patients with high risk for general anesthesia and those with splenomegaly due to a high risk of splenic injury were excluded from the study. Platelet or gamma globulin was transfused pre-operatively to patients who had a platelet count of <5 \u00d7 104/ul. We report here that three cases of NS in whom a 3-mm needlescope with a three-port technique was used, and a detailed literature review.
