ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: To compare the efficacy and safety of 177Lu-DOTATATE plus radiosensitizing capecitabine and octreotide long-acting release (LAR) as first-line systemic therapy in advanced well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs). Data of consecutive patients of advanced inoperable or metastatic grade 1 or 2 GEP-NETs treated with first-line 177Lu-DOTATATE plus radiosensitizing capecitabine or octreotide LAR from September 2012 to December 2019 were collected and analyzed for response, toxicity, and survival outcomes. Seventy-six patients (median age: 53 years; range 14-81 years) with treatment-na\u00efve advanced grade 1 or 2 GEP-NETs were included. Thirty-six patients received a median cumulative dose of 27.3 GBq of 177Lu-DOTATATE intravenously at 8-12 weeks' intervals along with 1,250 mg/m2 oral capecitabine on days 0-14 of each cycle of 177Lu-DOTATATE, whereas 40 patients were administered 30 mg octreotide LAR intramuscularly every 4 weeks. Using response evaluation criteria in solid tumor 1.1, the objective response rate was 38% in the 177Lu-DOTATATE arm compared with 15% in the octreotide LAR arm (P = .025), whereas the disease control rates were 88% and 67% in 177Lu-DOTATATE and octreotide LAR arms, respectively (P = .035). The median durations of progression-free survival in the 177Lu-DOTATATE and octreotide LAR arms were 54 months and 16 months, respectively (P = .017), whereas the median overall survival was not reached and not significantly different across both the arms. Of the treatment-related adverse events, no major difference was observed in the occurrence of grade 3 or 4 toxicities between the two treatment arms. First-line systemic 177Lu-DOTATATE plus radiosensitizing capecitabine achieved better radiologic response and longer progression-free survival compared with octreotide LAR in patients with advanced grade 1 or 2 GEP-NETs. Future randomized controlled trials are, however, required to determine the best treatment sequence for the treatment-na\u00efve patients with advanced GEP-NETs.
