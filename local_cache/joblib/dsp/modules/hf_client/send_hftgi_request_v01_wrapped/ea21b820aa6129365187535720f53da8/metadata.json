ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Two Sequential Clinical Isolates of Candida glabrata with Multidrug-Resistance to Posaconazole and Echinocandins. ABSTRACT: Candida glabrata is one of the most prevalent causative pathogens of invasive candidiasis, and multidrug-resistant strains are emerging. We identified two clinical isolates of C. glabrata, BMU10720 and BMU10722 sequentially isolated from one patient with multidrug-resistance to posaconazole (POS), caspofungin (CAS), micafungin (MCF), and anidulafungin (ANF). Overexpression of ERG11 in BMU10720 and CDR1 in BMU10722 were detected at basal level. When exposed to POS, CDR1 was significantly up-regulated in both isolates compared with susceptible reference strain, while ERG11 was up-regulated considerably only in BMU10720. PDR1 sequencing revealed that both isolates harbored P76S, P143T, and D243N substitutions, while ERG11 was intact. Cdr1 inhibitor FK520 reversed POS-resistance by down-regulating ERG11 expression. FKS sequencing revealed that both isolates harbored S663P substitution in FKS2, and four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) existed in FKS2 genes between BMU10720 and BMU10722, while FKS1 was intact. Both FKS1 and FKS2 were up-regulated by CAS in BMU10720 and BMU10722. FK520 down-regulated FKS2 expression induced by CAS through inhibiting calcineurin, resulting in synergic effect with echinocandins as well as Congo Red and Calcofluor White, two cell wall-perturbing agents. In conclusion, the multidrug-resistance of C. glabrata isolates in our study was conferred by different mechanisms. CDR1 and ERG11 overexpression in one isolate and only CDR1 overexpression in the other isolate may mediate POS-resistance. S663P mutation in FKS2 and up-regulation of FKS2 may contribute to echinocandin-resistance in both isolates. TEXT: pmc1.
