ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: A 73-year-old man with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) was being treated with hydroxyurea, which was changed to ruxolitinib treatment because of worsening constitutional symptoms. Although ruxolitinib rapidly induced relief, he developed a high-grade fever. A comprehensive fever work-up found no apparent cause of the fever, except for PMF. Therefore, we increased the dose of ruxolitinib and added prednisolone, which was gradually withdrawn with resolution of the fever. However, the patient subsequently developed disseminated tuberculosis and died eight months after initiation of ruxolitinib. Our case highlights the importance of assessing and monitoring the immune status of patients receiving ruxolitinib. TEXT: Introduction Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder resulting from mutations that include the JAK-STAT signaling regulator genes and/or epigenetic regulator genes (1). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only treatment with curative potential for PMF, with other treatment options being palliative and focused on alleviating the constitutional symptoms. Ruxolitinib, a selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, significantly reduces splenomegaly and relieves constitutional symptoms, which results in an improved quality of life for patients with PMF (2). Although ruxolitinib is a promising and active treatment option, several recent case reports have suggested that patients treated with ruxolitinib might be at risk for various opportunistic infections, including reactivation of tuberculosis (3). However, because of a lack of evidence, there are no criteria for identifying those high-risk patients being treated with ruxolitinib who should be considered for prophylaxis/treatment. We herein report a patient with PMF who developed fatal disseminated tuberculosis during treatment with ruxolitinib plus prednisolone. Case Report A 73-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of marked splenomegaly (6 cm below the costal margin), thrombocytosis, and an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level in April 2013. A bone marrow biopsy showed grade 3 fibrosis with the JAK2 V617F mutation. He was diagnosed with PMF with an intermediate-2 risk score by the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) Plus (4). Because ruxolitinib was not available in Japan at the time, he first received hydroxyurea (HU; 500 mg daily) to alleviate abdominal distension due to splenomegaly, which partially improved soon after the initiation of HU. However, his constitutional symptoms, including anemia, a low-grade fever, night sweats, and abdominal distention (splenomegaly 10 cm below the costal margin), worsened two years after starting HU.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596095.198206}
