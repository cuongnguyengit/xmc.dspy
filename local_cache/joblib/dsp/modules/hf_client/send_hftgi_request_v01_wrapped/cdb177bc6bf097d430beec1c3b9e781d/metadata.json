ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: The PT-Cy was considered as one of the mainstay protocol for graft verus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Recent study demonstrated that PT-Cy combined with other immunosuppressants could further reduce the incidence of GVHD and improve the GVHD and relapse free survival (GRFS). In this prospective phase II study, we evaluated the effect of a new GVHD prophylaxis consist of PT-Cy combined with tacrolimus and low dose anti-thymoglobulin (ATG). A total of 23 patients were enrolled including 20 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and three patients with T cell lymphoma. The median age was 29 years (range, 16~58 years). Patients with HLA-matched related donor (MSD, n=7) received PT-Cy combined with tacrolimus, while patients with HLA matched unrelated (MUD, n = 2) or haplo-identical (Haplo, n = 14) donor received additional ATG at 2.5 mg/kg on day 15 or day 22 after engraftment of neutrophils. As to the acute GVHD (aGVHD), only three patients developed grade I (n = 1) or grade II (n = 2) aGVHD with 100-day incidence of all aGVHD and II-IV aGVHD at 13.0 \u00b1 5.1% and 9.1 \u00b1 6.1% respectively. Only two patients had mild and one had moderate chronic GVHD (cGVHD), with 1-year incidence of cGVHD and moderate/severe cGVHD at 15.2 \u00b1 8.7% and 4.6 \u00b1 4.4% respectively. A high incidence of CMV reactivation was documented (14/16 with MUD/Haplo donor and 2/7 with MSD) with only 1 CMV disease documented. There were two EBV reactivation without post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) documented. With a median follow-up of 303 days (range, 75~700 days), three patients relapsed leading to 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) at 12.8 \u00b1 9.2%. Only one patient died of CMV pneumonia on day 91 with both 100-day and 1-year non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 4.6 \u00b1 4.4%. The 1-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS) and GRFS were 95.5 \u00b1 4.4%, 82.6 \u00b1 9.5%, and 68.0 \u00b1 11.3% respectively. Based on Simon's stage II design, our primary data showed that the PT-Cy+tacrolimus \u00b1 ATG protocol was promising in preventing aGVHD and cGVHD, which may translate into low NRM without increased CIR. Further clinical trial with large number of patients should be warranted. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT04118075. TEXT: Introduction Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is considered as a major complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) (1, 2). The post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) induced immune tolerance has been translated from laboratory studies into clinical practice and clinical data confirmed that PT-Cy can be considered as the mainstay strategy for GVHD prophylaxis in allo-HSCT of HLA-matched related (MSD), unrelated (MUD) and haplo-identical (Haplo) settings (3\u20138).\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597158.7502508}
