ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Methotrexate (MTX) is an effective, economical and safe drug used in the treatment of ectopic pregnancy. Complications are very rare. Herein, we reported a case of febrile neutropenia following single low-dose methotrexate for the treatment of ectopic pregnancy. Febrile neutropenia developed on day 4 of single-dose methotrexate administered intramuscularly. Although methotrexate single-dose regimen is quite effective and safe in ectopic pregnancy, febrile neutropenia can occur very rarely. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is defined as the placement of the fertilized ovum in a field outside the endometrial cavity. It is often seen in the tubal area, as well as in the hysterotomy scar, abdominal, ovarian, cervical, stump line, and rudimentary horn [1]. It accounts for 2% of all recognized pregnancies, and its frequency has been increasing worldwide in recent years [1]. At present, EP is a life-threatening condition and is still one of the most important causes of maternal loss in the first trimester [2]. EP can be treated medically or surgically. The choice of treatment varies depending on the clinical situation, EP localization, and available treatment options. Medical treatment has many advantages over surgical treatment in non-ruptured EP. These include less tubal damage, lower cost, and elevation in subsequent fertility potential. Methotrexate (MTX) is the most preferred agent in medical treatment for EP since the 1980s [1]. MTX is a folic antagonist that prevents deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis by inhibiting dihydrofolate reductase. It affects actively growing cells such as trophoblastic tissues, malignant cells, bone marrow, intestinal mucosa, and respiratory epithelium. The most important factor in the selection of treatment is a low side-effect and high-effectiveness profile. The most common side effects are stomatitis and conjunctivitis. Rare side effects include gastritis, enteritis, dermatitis, pneumonitis, alopecia, elevated liver enzymes, and bone marrow suppression. For febrile neutropenia, fever by single oral measurement without any environmental factors is defined as temperature > 38.3\u00b0C or >38.0\u00b0sC for >1 h [3]. Neutropenia is defined as neutrophil level < 500/mm3 or neutrophil level between 500 and 1000/mm3 and is expected to fall <500/mm3 within 48 h [3]. Febrile neutropenia is extremely rare when using a single dose of MTX for EP. Herein, we present the case of febrile neutropenia due to the use of single-dose MTX in the treatment of EP.
