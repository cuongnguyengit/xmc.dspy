ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is the most common hematologic emergency encountered during the treatment of high-grade malignancies. While it can lead to death, the prognosis is typically excellent if caught early on in the course. Risk stratification prior to treatment initiation is paramount in deciding the utility of prophylaxis and ultimately in reducing morbidity and mortality. The following case describes the development of TLS in a patient categorized as low risk and highlights the need for further elucidation of a unified risk stratification system. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a hematologic emergency most commonly encountered during the treatment of high-grade hematologic malignancies [1]. It is rarely seen in cases of solid tumors; however, as therapies continue to become more effective and more targeted, its frequency in these cases has been increasing [2, 3]. The syndrome occurs following rapid lysis of tumor cells causing release of intracellular contents into the bloodstream and can be classified as either laboratory or clinical via the Cairo and Bishop classification system [4]. Laboratory TLS is defined as the development of 2 of the following 4 laboratory abnormalities, in the same 24-h period, within 3 days prior to starting treatment and within 7 days after initiation of chemotherapy: hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Clinical TLS is defined as the presence of laboratory TLS plus acute kidney injury, cardiac arrhythmia, or symptomatic hypocalcemia (seizure and tetany). We present a rapidly fatal case of clinical TLS in a patient with stage IV pancreatic adenocarcinoma following palliative treatment with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. Case Presentation A 76-year-old female with a past medical history of stage III renal cell carcinoma status after right nephrectomy which did not require adjuvant treatment presented for follow-up to an outpatient clinic when she was found to have severe abdominal pain, tachycardia, and pallor. She had recently been diagnosed with pancreatic adenocarcinoma with metastatic disease to the liver complicated by splenic vein thrombosis. Upon admission to the hospital, she was found to have a leukocytosis count of 21,000 \u03bcL and was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics for concern of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Creatinine was found to be mildly elevated at 1.10 mg/dL, so she was started on maintenance fluids. Further laboratory tests were within normal limits. CT abdomen/pelvis was obtained which showed re-demonstration of the liver metastasis and peritoneal stranding, which was concerning for peritoneal carcinomatosis (Fig. 1). A family meeting was held, and the decision was made to move forward with palliative chemotherapy with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597145.4297938}
