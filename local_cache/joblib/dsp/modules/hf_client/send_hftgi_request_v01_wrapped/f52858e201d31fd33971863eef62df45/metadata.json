ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: The systemic toxicity of lidocaine is an extremely rare complication of thyroid RFA procedure, and it can be life-threatening. The quick recognization of its symptoms and intravenous use of lipid emulsion are essential to preventing mortality. TEXT: pmc1 INTRODUCTION This study describes a patient with lidocaine\u2010induced systemic toxicity during radiofrequency ablation of benign thyroid nodule procedure. The quick symptom recognization and intravenous lipid emulsion treatment are cornerstone to prevent mortality. This report emphasizes and discusses an extremely rare complication of thyroid RFA procedure. In recent years, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been emerging as one of the treatments of thyroid nodule(s). Theoretically, the RFA procedure usually used 2 basic techniques including the moving\u2010shot technique and the trans\u2010isthmic approach with the guidance of ultrasonography (US) after local anesthesia with 2% lidocaine at the needle\u2010puncture site and thyroid capsule. 1 , 2 To relieve pain, this procedure required a large amount of 2% lidocaine which could reach 25 ml in volume. 3 Systemic toxicity from using lidocaine, particularly in RFA procedure, is extremely scarce, but can reduce the effectiveness of treatment and even be potentially life\u2010threatening due to its toxic manifestations to the central nervous system (CNS) and cardiovascular system (CVS). 3 , 4 , 5 To the best of our knowledge, there are few reports of lidocaine\u2010induced systemic toxicity during thyroid RFA procedure in the literature. This report aims to describe a case of lidocaine\u2010induced systemic toxicity in a healthy 48\u2010year\u2010old female who underwent an RFA procedure for benign thyroid nodule at an outpatient clinic and to raise awareness among endocrinologists/surgeons/radiologists using RFA for the treatment of thyroid nodule(s) to identify and manage patients with lidocaine toxicity. 2 CASE PRESENTATION A 48\u2010year\u2010old South African woman presented with a left neck mass for 1 year with cosmetic concerns and no compressive symptoms. She reported no significant history of cardiovascular disease, and no history of food or drug allergies. No family history of any thyroid diseases and any allergies was reported. She was admitted to the hospital for a tentative thyroid radiofrequency ablation. Her body mass index was 24.5 kg/m2 (weight 66.7 kg; height 165 cm), and her blood pressure, heartbeat, SpO2, and body temperature were normal (113/71 mmHg, 70 beats/min, 96%, and 37.2\u00b0C, respectively). On physical examination, there was a soft mass in the left thyroid lobe, which was moving on swallowing (Figure 1A). Her report was no compressive symptoms, with a symptom score of 5/10 on a visual analog scale and a cosmetic score of \u00be. The physical examination of heart, lung, abdomen, and CNS was normal.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597064.0716953}
