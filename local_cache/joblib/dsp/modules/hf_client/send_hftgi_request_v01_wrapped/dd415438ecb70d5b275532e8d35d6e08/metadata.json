ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The HLH-94 protocol is a standard induction treatment for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. However, about 30% of patients may not respond. Ruxolitinib has been clinically proven to be an effective treatment for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). A previously healthy 14-year-old girl presented to the local hospital with a 4-day history of persistent fever and sore throat. METHODS Clinical and laboratory tests revealed fever >38.5\u00b0C, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypofibrinogenemia, hyperferritinemia, and an elevated interleukin-2 receptor level. METHODS This patient was treated with ruxolitinib and the HLH-94 protocol. RESULTS The patient's clinical and some laboratory indices improved. Unfortunately, vital signs such as respiratory function and consciousness did not improve. CONCLUSIONS This case report highlights the effect of using ruxolitinib in conjunction with the HLH-94 protocol. However, safety evaluation of this regimen was not performed because critically ill patient died too fast. TEXT: 1 Introduction Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a life-threatening disorder characterized by an excessive inflammatory response mediated by hyperactivation of T cells and antigen-presenting cells. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common triggering factor for HLH. EBV-associated HLH (EBV-HLH) can progress rapidly to multiorgan dysfunction. Symptoms of HLH include persistent pyrexia, pancytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, serum ferritin, and triglyceride levels, and decreased fibrinogen.[1,2] The HLH-94 protocol is a standard induction treatment for HLH, consisting of dexamethasone and etoposide.[3] However, about 30% of patients may not respond.[4] Ruxolitinib has been clinically proven to be effective to treat HLH.[5\u20137] Thus, we use ruxolitinib in conjunction with the HLH-94 protocol as the first-line treatment. Here we report a case of a patient with newly diagnosis EBV-triggered HLH who was critically ill and experienced improvement after ruxolitinib in conjunction with the HLH-94 protocol. 1.1 Consent statement The patient's family had provided informed consent for the publication of this case report. 2 Case report\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597064.0661385}
