ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: Osteoporosis is a key health problem in postmenopausal women with high social and economic impact. Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and deterioration of bone microarchitecture may occur also as a result of long-term glucocorticoid treatment (GCT) of autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Denosumab specifically inhibits the binding of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB to its ligand, thus preventing osteoclast activation and bone resorption. The efficacy and safety of denosumab, administered subcutaneously as 60 mg, once every six months for 12 months, were evaluated in 60 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) divided into two groups. The GCT group included 30 patients receiving concomitant glucocorticoid therapy and the non-GCT group included 30 patients that did not receive GCT. In the non-GCT group, the 12-month treatment with denosumab resulted in BMD increase of 6.1% and 2.8% in lumbar spine and hip, respectively. T-score increased by 13.1% and 5.6% in both, the lumbar spine and hip. A slight rise in the Trabecular Bone Score (TBS) of 0.3% was observed. Bone pain was markedly reduced by 56.2%. In the GCT group, denosumab therapy increased BMD with 5.8% and 2.3% in lumbar spine and hip, respectively. T-score of lumbar spine and hip significantly increased by 14.0% and 4.4%, and the TBS rose by 5%. Bone pain was reduced by 53.6%. These data confirm the available knowledge on denosumab efficacy and safety in women with PMO and also provide new insights into its therapeutic potential in patients with osteoporosis related to a long-term corticosteroid treatment. TEXT: Introduction Osteoporosis (OP) is a public health problem representing a common bone disease characterized by bone loss and structural deterioration of bone tissue. OP can lead to numerous other clinical and health-related consequences, including fracture, the need for long-term care and excess mortality. The reduced bone density associated with the disorder is a major risk factor for fracture, especially of the hip, spine and wrist.[1] OP is often referred to as a silent disease, as many individuals do not realize that they have the disease until a fracture occurs. OP-related fractures impose a heavy burden on individuals and on society, as they often lead to a variety of physical and psychological consequences, including future fractures, depression, functional impairment, pain and disability.[2] In postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) is directly associated with osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.[3,4] Osteoprotegerin binds to RANKL and is directly involved in the regulation of the RANK-RANKL pathway.[5]\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596538.9947913}
