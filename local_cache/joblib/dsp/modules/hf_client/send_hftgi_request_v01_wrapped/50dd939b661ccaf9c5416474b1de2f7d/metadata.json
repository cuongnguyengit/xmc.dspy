ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Testicular cancer is a rare disease; however, cure rates are high for all tumor stages. Mostly, the disease is diagnosed in an early (local) stage. We report the case of a 47-year-old male patient with a giant nonseminomatous germ cell tumor. At the time of diagnosis, the patient demonstrated a necrotizing and ulcerating growing mass in the left scrotum with an approximate size of 22 \u00d7 18 cm. According to the prognostic classification of the International Germ Cell Cancer Collaborative Group (IGCCCG 1997), the patient exhibited a high-risk profile due to alpha-fetoprotein >10,000 ng/mL and lactate dehydrogenase >10\u00d7 the upper limit of normal in serum. Primary orchiectomy was infeasible due to the tumor's size, the patient's poor general condition and initial intensive care unit treatment. Primary systemic chemotherapy was applied. After 3 cycles of cisplatin, etoposide and bleomycin, along with 1 cycle of cisplatin, etoposide and ifosfamide, tumor resection with histomorphological examination showed a complete pathological response. Despite the delayed initiation of the therapy, primary chemotherapy was completed timely and showed promising results. Reasons for the late hospitalization were personal responsibilities regarding his family. Better awareness and knowledge of testicular cancer among young men might prevent the here reported delay of medical consultation and avoid testicular tumors of such enormous size. Psychosocial assessment and distress management is important as an integral part of comprehensive care of testicular cancer patients.
