ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: To report a rare case of primary orbital natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma without nasal lesions but with cerebrospinal fluid involvement. A 73-year-old woman was referred to the uveitis clinic with suspected unilateral acute uveitis in her right eye and a right orbital tumor. Epstein-Barr virus DNA was detected in the aqueous humor in her right eye, and orbital biopsy revealed the presence of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal type. Positron emission tomography showed significant 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the right orbit, with no other signs of systemic involvement. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrated lymphoma cell infiltration. She was diagnosed with stage IV ENKTL and treated with orbital radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy, with subsequent remission. However, the lymphoma relapsed in her left vitreous at 10 months after therapy, suggesting metastasis of lymphoma cells to the contralateral eye via the vitreous and cerebrospinal fluid. A few cases of ocular-tissue ENKTL have been reported, mostly involving invasion or dissemination of primary nasal lesions; in contrast, primary orbital and intraocular ENKTL has rarely been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a primary orbital ENKTL metastasizing to the vitreous of the contralateral eye. Although ENKTL is rare in the orbit and intraocular tissues, it should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis in patients with orbital tumors or intraocular inflammation resistant to steroid therapy because ENKTL has a very poor prognosis in the advanced stage. TEXT: 1 Introduction Lymphomas are the most common type of primary orbital malignant tumors. Most orbital lymphomas are non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, such as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, which have a relatively good prognosis, while T-cell and natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphomas are extremely rare.1,2 Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal type, formerly known as lethal midline granuloma, angiocentric T-cell lymphoma, or polymorphic reticulosis, is an uncommon disease that typically arises from the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.2,3 While most NK/T-cell lymphomas in ocular tissues occur as an invasion or dissemination of nasal ENKTL, a few cases of primary orbital or intraocular ENKTL have been reported.3,4 Here we report an extremely rare case of primary orbital NKTCL that metastasized to the contralateral eye during the follow-up period, presumably via the vitreous and cerebrospinal fluid. 2 Case report\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596057.8934987}
