ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: The development of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with oncogenic driver mutations highlights the challenge in improving the survival of these patients. The standard of care for ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC refractory to various generations of ALK TKIs falls back to the use of chemotherapy and the prognosis remains poor. We report the case of a 41-year-old lady with an ALK-translocated metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, who demonstrated good response to an immune checkpoint inhibitor, atezolizumab in combination with bevacizumab and chemotherapy (pemetrexed and carboplatin), following disease progression on three generations of ALK TKIs. Six months into treatment, she continues to show improvement in her health-related quality of life and is tolerating treatment well. Our case suggests that this treatment regimen is a potential treatment option for TKI-refractory driver-mutated NSCLC. TEXT: 1 Introduction Treating anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-translocated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) is a validated molecular-targeted strategy that is superior to chemotherapy in terms of progression-free survival (PFS) [1,2]. However, the durability of its clinical benefit remains limited by the emergence of resistance to ALK TKI. The standard of care for metastatic NSCLC with ALK translocation refractory to various generations of ALK TKIs falls back to chemotherapy and the prognosis remains poor. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), specifically programmed death-1 (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, have revolutionized the treatment landscape of metastatic NSCLC with their improved survival rates and controlled toxicity. Atezolizumab is the first PD-L1 inhibitor to have shown robust efficacy in metastatic NSCLC [3,4]. However, information on the efficacy of ICIs in advanced NSCLC with oncogenic driver alterations remains scarce and contradictory. Studies have shown low objective response rates and short median PFS of 0.6\u20131.9 months with the use of ICI monotherapy in advanced NSCLCs harboring ALK translocations regardless of PD-L1 expression status [[5], [6], [7]]. The IMPOWER150 trial demonstrated that the addition of atezolizumab to bevacizumab and chemotherapy significantly improved median PFS (9.7 months vs. 6.1 months; hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.94) in metastatic NSCLC with ALK or EGFR alterations, albeit the small number of ALK-positive patients in this study (n = 34, 4.3%) limits definitive conclusions from being drawn in this subgroup of patients [4]. Regardless, findings of this landmark trial suggest that driver-mutated NSCLC that has ceased to respond to TKIs may benefit from an atezolizumab combination therapy.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597080.0048304}
