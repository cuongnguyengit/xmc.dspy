ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Background Neonatal hemochromatosis (NH) is a rare condition that was the main reason for liver transplantation in infants. With the realization that NH results from the fetal complement-mediated liver injury, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) were successfully introduced for the treatment. Case Presentation We present two cases of NH from the same family to illustrate the role of antenatal treatment with IVIG in alleviation and possible prevention of this serious morbidity. Conclusion A prenatal treatment and early postnatal administration of IVIG are effective ways to manage NH that help to reduce the severity of the symptoms, prevent liver failure, and avoid the need for liver transplantation. TEXT: Neonatal hemochromatosis (NH) is a rare condition that presents with early liver failure accompanied by hepatic and extrahepatic iron deposition (sideration). 1 For many years, NH was the main reason for liver transplantation in infants; supportive treatment with antioxidants and chelation was ineffective and was associated with severe side effects. 1 2 3 With the realization that NH results from the fetal complement-mediated liver injury, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) were successfully introduced for the treatment that subsequently resulted in increased survival rate and decreased need for liver transplantation. 3 4 We present two cases of NH from the same family to illustrate the role of antenatal treatment with IVIG in alleviation and possible prevention of this serious morbidity.
