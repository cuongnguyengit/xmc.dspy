ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Recently, the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with or without chemotherapeutic agents has been increasing in the treatment for advanced cancer. Here, we report the occurrence of liver failure after the use of pembrolizumab in an 82-year-old woman with metastatic liver disease derived from right advanced renal pelvis, ureteral cancer, and bladder cancer. She was successfully treated with 0.6 mg/kg daily prednisolone. In patients treated with ICIs, ICI-induced hepatitis is occasionally observed. Even if patients are older, it appears important to diagnose and treat ICI-induced hepatitis earlier by multidisciplinary therapies including steroid treatment. This is a first report of pembrolizumab-induced liver failure in elder patient with age over 80 years. Even if patients are older, it appears important to diagnose and treat ICI-induced hepatitis earlier by multidisciplinary therapies including steroid treatment. TEXT: Introduction Treatments with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) blocking cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated protein\u20104 (CTLA\u20104) and the programmed death\u20101 (PD\u20101) axis are common for advanced cancer. 1 PD\u20101 is a checkpoint that regulates the immune response. Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal anti\u2010PD\u20101 antibody that is effective in many cancer therapies. It is well known that patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma that progresses after platinum\u2010based chemotherapy have a poor prognosis. 2 Pembrolizumab is associated with significantly longer overall survival and a lower rate of treatment\u2010related adverse events than chemotherapy as a second\u2010line therapy for platinum\u2010refractory advanced urothelial carcinoma. 2 Pembrolizumab is one of the treatment options for patients with platinum\u2010refractory advanced urothelial cancer. 2 Abnormality of liver function is occasionally observed during treatment with ICIs. Because ICIs are usually used for the patients with advanced cancer, metastatic liver disease, vascular liver disease accompanied with the use of anti\u2010vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, drug\u2010induced liver injury (DILI), exacerbation of viral hepatitis, autoimmune liver disease, ICI\u2010induced hepatitis, and metabolic liver disease may occur during ICI treatment. We herein describe the occurrence of liver failure without encephalopathy as an immune\u2010related adverse event (irAE) in an elderly woman after receiving pembrolizumab for metastatic liver disease derived from right advanced renal pelvis, ureteral cancer and bladder cancer. In the presented patient with metastatic liver disease, ICI\u2010induced hepatitis caused liver failure as an acute insult. We successfully treated this patient with 0.6 mg/kg daily prednisolone.
