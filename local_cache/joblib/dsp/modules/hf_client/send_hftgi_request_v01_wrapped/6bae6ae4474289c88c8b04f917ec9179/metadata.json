ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: A Pilot Trial on the Effect of Levothyroxine on Proteinuria in Patients With Advanced CKD. ABSTRACT: Thyroid hormones can directly affect kidney function; elevated levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) are associated with proteinuria, decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and progression to end-stage renal disease. Our hypothesis is that in patients with CKD and TSH at levels considered to be in the low subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) range, lowering TSH with levothyroxine (LVX) improves the clinical parameters of renal function. This was a double-blind, randomized, pilot clinical trial in patients with proteinuric CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 and proteinuria >150 mg/d) performed at the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, with the intention of lowering TSH (levels of 1.25-2.5 \u03bcIU/l) in patients with TSH (levels of 2.6-9.9 \u03bcIU/ml with FT4 in the range of 0.7-1.8 ng/dl). Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive LVX or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary objective was to evaluate absolute levels of proteinuria at the beginning compared to the end of the study and, as a secondary objective, the changes in serum creatinine (sCr), eGFR, cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and blood pressure, and to assess the tolerability and safety of LVX. Between March and November 2018, a total of 163 patients were assessed for eligibility; 119 patients did not meet the inclusion criteria or were excluded, and 32 patients were randomized. The demographic and clinical characteristics of the 2 study groups were essentially not different. Subjects were 66.87 (SD 12.19) years of age, 62.5% were female, 75% were diabetes mellitus, eGFR was 23.55 (\u00b112.91) ml/min per 1.73 m2, TSH was 5.37 \u00b1 2.13 \u03bcIU/ml, proteinuria in 24-hour urine collection was 1.52 \u00b1 1.12, and all of them were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). Proteinuria at 12 weeks in the LVX group was 0.89 SD \u00b1 1.28 g/d, and in the placebo group it was 1.35 SD \u00b1 0.85 g/d; when compared to placebo, LVX showed a significant decrease in proteinuria of 1.1 g/d (P = 0.0011). The eGFR in the LVX group showed an improvement of 4 ml/min/1.73 m2 (P = 0.049); in the placebo group, there was a decrease of 1.98 ml/min per 1.73 m2. The sCr, cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure were not different between groups. Adverse events were reported in the LVX group in 7.14% of patients and in 11.11% of patients in the placebo group; none left the study because of adverse effects, and there were no serious adverse events.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597066.078013}
