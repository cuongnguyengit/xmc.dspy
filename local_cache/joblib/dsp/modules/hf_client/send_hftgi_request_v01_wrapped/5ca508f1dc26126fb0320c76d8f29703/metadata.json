ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: The diagnostic evaluation of an individual with clinical and laboratory evidence of thyroid dysfunction in the setting of acute liver injury is crucial. There is a complex relationship between the thyroid and the liver, and so, it requires a careful elucidation of the inciting disease process before instituting a treatment plan. We discuss a patient who had presented with coagulopathy, encephalopathy, and laboratory evidence of acute liver injury, hence adjudged to have developed drug-induced acute liver failure and transferred for liver transplant evaluation. She was found to have liver dysfunction from uncontrolled thyroid disease, with immediate and rapid improvement after controlling severe hyperthyroidism. TEXT: INTRODUCTION There is a well-known physiologic and pathologic relationship that exists between the liver and the thyroid gland. For this reason, the diagnostic evaluation of an individual with clinical and laboratory evidence of thyroid dysfunction in the setting of acute liver injury is crucial. It requires a careful elucidation of the inciting disease process before instituting a treatment plan. Here, we present a patient, adjudged to have developed drug-induced acute liver failure, who was found to have liver dysfunction from uncontrolled thyroid disease. CASE REPORT A 66-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation on warfarin, as well as a recent diagnosis of Graves disease (positive thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins and radioactive iodine uptake of 99%) was transferred to our facility with a diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury with resultant acute liver failure. She had initially presented with several weeks of malaise after being started on methimazole for her Graves disease, and she had taken this medication for only 4 days. Initial laboratory findings included markedly elevated liver transaminases, and her international normalized ratio (INR) was also high (Figures 1 and 2). Although she was being assessed and stabilized in the emergency department, she developed rapid deterioration of her mental status with lethargy, weakness, and progressed to frank confusion and somnolence. This led to urgent endotracheal intubation to ensure airway protection. To evaluate her confusion, an magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was obtained which did not show any acute intracranial pathology but noted findings suggesting chronic small vessel ischemic disease and mild diffuse cerebral atrophy. Based on the findings of coagulopathy and progressive encephalopathy in the setting of acute liver injury, she was diagnosed as having acute liver failure, N-acetylcysteine was started, and she was transferred to our transplant center for evaluation for liver transplantation.
