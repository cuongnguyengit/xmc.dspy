ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Extra-articular involvement of rheumatoid arthritis in three seropositive patients in the absence of initial joint involvement. ABSTRACT: Extra-articular involvement (EAI) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is rare, severe and usually presents after years of joint involvement. Onset of RA as lung involvement has been published. We describe a series of three patients with strongly positive anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA) and rheumatoid factor (RF) positive in the absence of joint symptoms, but with significant EAI. This is a descriptive case series of three patients evaluated in an academic medical center rheumatology clinic. A 50-year-old female presented with severe recurrent scleritis in the background of strongly positive ACPA, but no joint involvement. Her ocular disease responded well to rituximab. Four years later, she developed peripheral inflammatory arthritis consistent with RA. A 74-year-old male presented after developing recurrent steroid-dependent serositis (pleuro-pericarditis) and interstitial lung disease (ILD). Serology was notable for strongly positive ACPA, but no joint involvement. Serositis responded well to adalimumab. Two years after initial symptoms, he developed peripheral joint involvement after holding adalimumab. A 56-year-old female presented with an isolated, biopsy-proven subcutaneous rheumatoid nodule. Subsequently, she developed pancytopenia and fatigue. She tested strongly positive for ACPA and RF. Bone marrow biopsy was negative for malignancy and she had no evidence of infection. She responded to steroids and hydroxychloroquine and had not developed joint involvement after 2 years of follow-up. EAI as an onset of RA is a complex and not easily recognized entity if typical joints involvement is not yet present. Early diagnosis may help guide specific therapy and prevent sequelae and co-morbidities. TEXT: pmc1 INTRODUCTION Extra\u2010articular involvement (EAI) or systemic manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) include rheumatoid nodules, interstitial lung disease, vasculitis with potential cutaneous and neuropathic involvement, serositis and eye disease. 1 The hallmark of RA is prolonged morning stiffness and symmetric inflammatory arthritis involving the small joints of the hands and feet. Isolated EAI of RA without joint manifestations is exceptionally rare, except for lung involvement.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597184.731369}
