ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \u201cI think I\u2019m having a stroke.\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient. We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Hypokalemic paralysis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, thiazide diuretics, alcohol abuse, anxiety, hypertension\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Primary histiocytic sarcoma of the central nervous system. ABSTRACT: Histiocytic sarcoma is a type of lymphoma that rarely involves the central nervous system (CNS). Its rarity can easily lead to a misdiagnosis. We describe a patient with primary CNS histocytic sarcoma involving the cerebral hemisphere and spinal cord, who had been initially misdiagnosed as demyelinating disease. Two biopsies were necessary before a correct diagnosis was made. A histologic examination showed bizarre shaped histiocytes with larger nuclei and nuclear atypia. The cells were positive for CD68, CD163, and S-100 protein. As a resection was not feasible due to multifocality, he was treated with highdose methotrexate, but showed no response. As a result, he was switched to high dose cytarabine; but again, showed no response. The patient died 2 months from the start of chemotherapy and 8 months from the onset of symptoms. Since few patients with this condition have been described and histopathology is difficult to diagnose, suspicion of the disease is essential. TEXT: Introduction Histiocytes are cells fully differentiated from the monocyte/ macrophage lineage and Langerhans/dendritic cells. Histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms are classified together by the World Health Organization, based on the cell function, rather than histogenesis. Histiocytic sarcomas are malignant proliferations of non-Langerhans histiocytes, excluding acute monocytic leukemias and associated neoplasms [1]. The pathogenesis of histiocytic sarcoma remains unclear. Furthermore, it can occur at any age, from infancy to adulthood, with several series reporting a greater predilection in males than in females. The most frequently involved organs are the skin, lymph nodes, and intestinal tract; however, it can also involve other organs. Clinical manifestations depend on the involved organs and can range from an asymptomatic single mass to systemic symptoms, including fever and weight loss. To date, only tens of cases have been reported to involve the central nervous system (CNS) (Table 1) [2-14]. These patients usually have an extremely poor prognosis. We describe here a patient with primary CNS histiocytic sarcoma, with the involvement of multiple areas within the cerebral hemisphere and spinal cord, who was initially misdiagnosed as having demyelinating disease. Case Report A 59-year-old man was presented with progressive right side weakness and numbness in the left leg for 2 months. The deep tendon reflex on his right side was hyperactive, but there was no evidence of dysarthria, dysphagia, or defecation problems. His past history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Laboratory findings were unremarkable. Blood glucose concentration was under control, and blood pressure was maintained around 140/90 mm Hg.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596810.37614}
