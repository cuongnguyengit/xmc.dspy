ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: We herein report the case of 21-year-old female diagnosed with adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) three years earlier who presented with fever and right upper abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC) based on hepatic dysfunction, elevated C-reactive protein, and gallbladder wall thickening on abdominal ultrasound. Based on the presence of pancytopenia, hyperferritinemia, and hemophagocytosis by a bone marrow examination, she was diagnosed with macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) which was refractory to glucocorticoid pulse therapy. The combination of intravenous cyclosporine A with glucocorticoids was able to successfully control the disease activity of AOSD-related AAC and MAS/HLH. TEXT: Introduction Adult-onset Still's disease (AOSD) is a systemic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that is characterized by fever, arthritis, characteristic rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and hyperferritinemia. The pathogenesis of AOSD is considered to involve various inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-18, and interferon-\u03b3 (1). Some cases might be complicated by macrophage activation syndrome (MAS)/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a fatal condition caused by hypercytokinemia which can lead to multi-organ failure (2). Conversely, acute acalculous cholecystitis (AAC), a relatively rare organ complication of AOSD (3,4), has been reported to be complicated by connective tissue diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Since it is a rare complication of AOSD, there is no consensus on the course of treatment for AOSD related AAC, partly because it can be observed as AOSD-related organ failure following surgical cholecystectomy (4,5). We herein report the case of a patient presenting with concurrent MAS/HLH and AAC at the time of AOSD relapse who was successfully treated only with glucocorticoids and cyclosporine A (CsA).
