ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Haberland syndrome or encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis is a rare ectomesodermal dysgenesis defined by the triad including ocular, skin, and central nervous system involvement, which is commonly unilateral. This disorder is attributed to a post-zygotic mutation responsible for a neural tube and neural crest dysgenesis. We report the case of a 15-year-old female with Haberland syndrome with pharmacoresistant epilepsy who developed a World Health Organization-grade IV glioblastoma. This is the first case of pediatric glioblastoma associated with Haberland syndrome. The previously reported pediatric cases included benign brain tumors. To our knowledge, this is the fifth case of brain tumor associated with encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis and the second case of glioblastoma associated with this syndrome. The hypothesis that Haberland syndrome is associated with an increased risk of tumor development is intriguing, although the rarity of the condition is nowadays preventing us from drawing definitive conclusions about this potential link between the two entities. Further studies are needed to establish the real relationship between encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis and the risk of brain tumors. TEXT: Introduction Haberland syndrome or encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis is a rare ectomesodermal dysgenesis defined by the triad including ocular, skin, and central nervous system involvement, which is commonly unilateral (1). This disorder is attributed to a post-zygotic mutation responsible for a neural tube and neural crest dysgenesis (2). We report the case of an adolescent with Haberland syndrome who developed a glioblastoma. It is possible to hypothesize that Haberland syndrome, similarly to most of the neurocutaneous syndromes, is associated with a predisposition to cancer development. Case Description We describe the case of a 15-year-old female who was diagnosed with Haberland syndrome during infancy due to the presence of clinical signs including palpebral telangectasias, facial lipomas, angiomas of the trunk, scalp alopecia, scleral dermatolipomas, irideal abnormalities, and unilateral mandibular swelling. She also presented with severe mental and speech retardation and pharmacoresistant epilepsy. At the age of 18 months, she started to present with focal motor onset seizures with automatisms and impaired awareness. During early childhood, she presented with episodes of facial pallor, perioral cyanosis, and chewing automatisms without consciousness impairment. During school-age, focal non-motor onset autonomic aware seizures were observed. Therapy included combinations of Valproate, Topiramate, Phenobarbital, Delorazepam, Clonazepam, and Rufinamide.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597084.3670564}
