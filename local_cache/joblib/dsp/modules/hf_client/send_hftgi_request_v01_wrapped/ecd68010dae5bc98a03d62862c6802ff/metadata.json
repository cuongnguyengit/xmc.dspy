ABSTRACT: Conventional skeletal chondrosarcoma is a bone neoplasm, which is poorly sensitive to anthracyclines-based chemotherapy. We report on an 18-month-long tumour response to gemcitabine as single agent in a young patient with an advanced secondary peripheral conventional chondrosarcoma, previously treated unsuccessfully with anthracyclines, ifosfamide, platinum, etoposide. TEXT: Background The skeletal chondrosarcoma family represents a heterogeneous group of malignant bone mesenchymal tumours characterised by the production of a chondroid matrix. They are the third bone sarcoma in incidence, and the most frequent in adults. There are three main subtypes: conventional, mesenchymal, and clear-cell. A \u201cdedifferentiated\u201d chondrosarcoma develops in 10-15% of conventional chondrosarcomas, while mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a high-grade, aggressive neoplasm with a natural history and chemosensitivity that might be close to Ewing sarcoma, and clear-cell chondrosarcoma is a low-grade variant [1]. In conventional chondrosarcoma (cCS), the histological malignancy grade is the main prognostic factor [2]. Grade 1 cCS are characterised by a very low metastatic potential, and some authors have quite recently suggested a re-classification of these types as \u201catypical cartilaginous tumours\u201d [1]. Grade 2 and 3 cCS are marked by a higher metastatic potential, with a 10-year survival of 64-86% and 29-55% respectively [3,4]. CCSs are also categorised according to their location in the bone: a central chondrosarcoma onsets in the medullary cavity, a small percentage of them from a pre-existing benign lesion known as enchondroma, while a peripheral variant arises from the surface of the bone, as a result of malignant progression of a pre-existing benign (solitary or hereditary) osteochondroma. Surgery is the mainstay of the treatment of localized disease. While curettage is acceptable for grade 1 cCS, wide excision is usually required for higher grade cCS, with the exception of skull base cCS which may be treated with radiotherapy. In particular, hadrons can play an important role in the management of skull base cCS, and very good outcomes are reported [5].\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \"found down\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \u201ccatch up\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: Osteoporosis is a key health problem in postmenopausal women with high social and economic impact. Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and deterioration of bone microarchitecture may occur also as a result of long-term glucocorticoid treatment (GCT) of autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Denosumab specifically inhibits the binding of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB to its ligand, thus preventing osteoclast activation and bone resorption. The efficacy and safety of denosumab, administered subcutaneously as 60 mg, once every six months for 12 months, were evaluated in 60 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) divided into two groups. The GCT group included 30 patients receiving concomitant glucocorticoid therapy and the non-GCT group included 30 patients that did not receive GCT. In the non-GCT group, the 12-month treatment with denosumab resulted in BMD increase of 6.1% and 2.8% in lumbar spine and hip, respectively. T-score increased by 13.1% and 5.6% in both, the lumbar spine and hip. A slight rise in the Trabecular Bone Score (TBS) of 0.3% was observed. Bone pain was markedly reduced by 56.2%. In the GCT group, denosumab therapy increased BMD with 5.8% and 2.3% in lumbar spine and hip, respectively. T-score of lumbar spine and hip significantly increased by 14.0% and 4.4%, and the TBS rose by 5%. Bone pain was reduced by 53.6%. These data confirm the available knowledge on denosumab efficacy and safety in women with PMO and also provide new insights into its therapeutic potential in patients with osteoporosis related to a long-term corticosteroid treatment. TEXT: Introduction Osteoporosis (OP) is a public health problem representing a common bone disease characterized by bone loss and structural deterioration of bone tissue. OP can lead to numerous other clinical and health-related consequences, including fracture, the need for long-term care and excess mortality. The reduced bone density associated with the disorder is a major risk factor for fracture, especially of the hip, spine and wrist.[1] OP is often referred to as a silent disease, as many individuals do not realize that they have the disease until a fracture occurs. OP-related fractures impose a heavy burden on individuals and on society, as they often lead to a variety of physical and psychological consequences, including future fractures, depression, functional impairment, pain and disability.[2] In postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) is directly associated with osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.[3,4] Osteoprotegerin binds to RANKL and is directly involved in the regulation of the RANK-RANKL pathway.[5]\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to', 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596262.3858578}
