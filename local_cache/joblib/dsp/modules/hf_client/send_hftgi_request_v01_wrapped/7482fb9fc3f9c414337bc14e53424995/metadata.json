ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Central nervous system demyelination caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors is a very rare condition. A 65-year-old man who received nivolumab for renal cell carcinoma developed abnormal behavior, such as disagreeable speech and sudden anger. Brain-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple lesions with partial contrast effects in the cerebral white matter. We tentatively diagnosed demyelination caused by nivolumab, and performed steroid pulse therapy twice. After that, his symptoms improved. For the next 2 years, his symptoms did not recur, nor did his cancer progress. Demyelination caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors can be fatal and requires early diagnosis and treatment.

Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. Steroids may be required, depending on symptoms. Introduction Nivolumab, an anti\u2010PD\u20101 inhibitor, is widely used to treat various cancers, including RCC; however, numerous irAEs have been reported. Neurologic irAEs are relatively rare, 1 especially neurologic irAEs with CNS demyelination. Here, we report an extremely rare case of RCC with CNS demyelination caused by nivolumab. Case presentation A 52\u2010year\u2010old man underwent a left nephrectomy in another hospital for left RCC in 2004 (pathological diagnosis unknown). He developed left lung metastases in 2010, and started treatment with interferon\u2010\u03b1. Right renal metastasis also appeared in 2010 (Fig. 1a), so he was referred to our hospital and underwent a right partial nephrectomy. Later, he also underwent a left partial pneumonectomy (Fig. 1b,c). The histopathological finding of each excised tissue showed clear cell RCC. In April 2015, he began sunitinib treatment for multiple lung metastases (Fig. 1d,e) (International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium risk group was favorable), but a lumbar spine metastasis was found in February 2016 (Fig. 1f). His medication was switched from sunitinib to axitinib in November 2016. In October 2017, he began taking nivolumab because of the progression of lung metastases and appearance of left hilar lymph node disease (Fig. 1g,h). In January 2018, he received a transarterial embolization for his left hilar lymph node, because of progressive disease. Both the hilar lymph node and lung disease showed durable responses.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597056.9941692}
