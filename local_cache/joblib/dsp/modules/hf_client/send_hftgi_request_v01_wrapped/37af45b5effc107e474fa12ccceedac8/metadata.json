ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Neoadjuvant durvalumab plus weekly nab-paclitaxel and dose-dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide in triple-negative breast cancer. ABSTRACT: The goal of this Phase I/II trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of administering durvalumab concurrent with weekly nab-paclitaxel and dose-dense doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (ddAC) neoadjuvant therapy for stages I-III triple-negative breast cancer. The primary endpoint is pathologic complete response (pCR:ypT0/is, ypN0). The response was correlated with PDL1 expression and stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs). Two dose levels of durvalumab (3 and 10 mg/kg) were assessed. PD-L1 was assessed using the SP263 antibody; \u22651% immune and tumor cell staining was considered positive; sTILs were calculated as the area occupied by mononuclear inflammatory cells over the total intratumoral stromal area. 59 patients were evaluable for toxicity and 55 for efficacy in the Phase II study (10 mg/kg dose). No dose-limiting toxicities were observed in Phase I. In Phase II, pCR rate was 44% (95% CI: 30-57%); 18 patients (31%) experienced grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events (AE), most frequently neutropenia (n = 4) and anemia (n = 4). Immune-related grade 3/4 AEs included Guillain-Barre syndrome (n = 1), colitis (n = 2), and hyperglycemia (n = 2). Of the 50 evaluable patients for PD-L1, 31 (62%) were PD-L1 positive. pCR rates were 55% (95% CI: 0.38-0.71) and 32% (95% CI: 0.12-0.56) in the PD-L1 positive and negative groups (p = 0.15), respectively. sTIL counts were available on 52 patients and were significantly higher in the pCR group (p = 0.0167). Concomitant administration of durvalumab with sequential weekly nab-paclitaxel and ddAC neoadjuvant chemotherapy resulted in a pCR rate of 44%; pCR rates were higher in sTIL-high cancers.
