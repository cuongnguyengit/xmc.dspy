ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon and life-threating condition characterized by major immune activation and massive cytokine production by mononuclear inflammatory cells, due to defects in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. It is even more unusual in renal transplant recipients, in which it is often associated with uncontrolled infection. The mortality is high in HLH and differential diagnosis with sepsis is a challenge. The approach and management depend on the underlying trigger and comorbidities. We report a case of a 50-year-old renal transplant female admitted with fever and malaise 3 months post-transplant and presenting anemia, fever, hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of serum ferritin, and positive CMV antigenemia. Urine was positive for decoy cells and BKV-DNA. Graft biopsy showed CMV nephritis. Both blood and urine cultures where positive for E. coli. Hemophagocytosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone, with complete response after 3 weeks. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of a rare and serious condition in a renal transplant patient, which can allow a favorable clinical course and improve survival rate. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) consists of an immune hyperactivation syndrome that takes place when NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to eliminate activated macrophages, leading to over production of proinflammatory cytokines1. There are primary and acquired causes. Primary HLH is rare and typically manifests in childhood because of two autosomal recessive defects in genes that encode proteins involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules during apoptosis in natural killer (NK) cells.1 , 2Acquired (secondary) HLH is triggered by various conditions as infections, immunodeficiency, rheumatologic diseases, and cancer.1 , 3 , 4 Infection is the most common precipitating factor of HLH in adults, mainly viruses of herpes family (EBV, CMV, HSV, HHV8), but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens can also be a trigger.5 , 6 Multiorgan involvement and organomegaly are frequently found and hemophagocytosis results in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of HLH is based on the presence of at least 5 of the following 8 criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting \u2265 2 lineages of peripheral blood cells), hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, serum ferritin >500 ng/mL, low activity of NK cells, soluble CD25 > 2.400 U/mL and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes.7 Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red cells, platelets, or white cells in macrophage cytoplasm visualized in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.2 The syndrome is defined by a complex picture. However, some patients may have incipient or partial disease.1 Most diagnostic\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: It is well known that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors can cause proteinuria. The incidence of proteinuria is high for bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against VEGF, but the range of proteinuria rarely becomes nephrotic (2.2% occurrence according to a meta-analysis). In such cases, renal pathology shows thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Ramucirumab, anti-VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) monoclonal antibody, can also cause proteinuria, but it is not yet reported whether the drug may induce TMA. Here, we report a case who immediately developed TMA by ramucirumab after multiple courses of bevacizumab treatment. This is the first case of pathologically-proved TMA by ramucirumab. After cessation of the drug, symptoms of TMA improved gradually. This case demonstrates that not only blockade of VEGF but also VEGFR2 antagonism may result in TMA, which is a rare but life-threatening complication of cancer treatment drug. TEXT: Background Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors are increasingly applied to treat a number of malignancies such as metastatic or recurrent colorectal, non-small cell lung, breast, and renal cell cancers. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeted against VEGF, is broadly used as the first- or second-line therapy to various malignancies [1]. The drug often causes proteinuria in treated patients [2], but it is rare bevacizumab-induced proteinuria reaches to a nephrotic range [3]. In such cases, renal pathology shows thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) and, at the molecular level, inactivating VEGF signaling leads to damage of glomerular endothelial cells [4]. Other drugs, such as VEGF Trap (anti-VEGF ligand inhibitor) [5] or multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (including sunitinib, sorafenib and pazopanib) [6] may cause proteinuria and TMA. Ramucirumab, anti-VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) monoclonal antibody, is approved for treating gastric, non-small-cell lung, and metastatic colorectal cancers as the second-line therapy. Ramucirumab also potentiates proteinuria [7], but it is unknown whether ramucirumab use is associated with development of TMA. Here, we report a case in which TMA occurred immediately after switching chemotherapy from bevacizumab to ramucirumab.
