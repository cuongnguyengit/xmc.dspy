ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Procalcitonin (PCT) is used as a biomarker for identifying the occurrence of sepsis. Previous studies have reported high levels of PCT with acetaminophen intoxication without evidence of infection. Here, we report two patients with acetaminophen intoxication with high levels of PCT without showing any symptoms of bacterial infection. This case study examined two unrelated patients with acetaminophen intoxication admitted to emergency at different times. The first patient was admitted to the emergency department after ingesting approximately 8000 mg (153.8 mg/kg) of acetaminophen. On admission, C-reactive protein (CRP), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were normal. PCT and acetaminophen levels were 31.89 ng/mL and below 0.5 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The second patient was admitted to the emergency department 8 h after ingesting \u223c23,600 mg (280.6 mg/kg) of acetaminophen. By the second day of admission, GOT and GPT increased to 2508 and 1473 IU/L, respectively. PCT was 45.66 ng/mL with acetaminophen level at 116.9 \u03bcg/mL. Both patients were clear of symptoms associated with bacterial infection. METHODS Acetaminophen intoxication. METHODS N-acetylcysteine was given intravenously to both patients for 20 h per protocol. RESULTS Both patients were discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS Observations suggests that elevated levels of PCT in patients intoxicated with acetaminophen may be associated with involvement of other organs impacted by cytokine stimuli from sterile inflammation resulting from hepatic damage rather than PCT secretion directly caused by hepatic cell damage. TEXT: 1 Introduction Procalcitonin (PCT) is used as an effective biomarker in identifying sepsis as well as to help determine the duration of antibiotics used in a patient.[1\u20135] However, recent studies have shown that bacterial infection may not be the only cause resulting in elevated PCT levels. PCT levels can be elevated in patients experiencing acute liver failure (ALF) associated with acetaminophen intoxication without infection.[5\u20137] This demonstrates that a measure of PCT does not always correlate with the probability of infection.[5\u20137] One study has documented extremely elevated levels of PCT in children with ALF due to acetaminophen intoxication without evidence of bacterial infection that could not be explained by drug induced liver cell injury and/or hidden bacterial infection.[5] Although the exact mechanisms of increased PCT levels in acetaminophen intoxication were unclear, the results of these previous studies suggest that high PCT levels in acetaminophen intoxication might be associated with involvement of other organs affected by cytokine stimuli in addition to liver cell damage.[5\u20137]\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596059.7255085}
