ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: The peritonitis caused by gram-negative organisms is a serious complication encountered in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, often causing high morbidity and mortality. There has been recognition of peritonitis caused by uncommon organisms because of improved microbiological detection techniques. The healthcare providers involved in the management of these patients should be very vigilant. We report a rare case of peritonitis caused by Citrobacter freundii. A 42-year-old male on peritoneal dialysis for five years presented with abdominal pain and cloudy effluent. The peritoneal fluid analysis was consistent with peritonitis, and peritoneal fluid culture grew Citrobacter freundii. The patient was treated with two courses of double antibiotic coverage with intraperitoneal ceftazidime and oral ciprofloxacin, which failed to resolve the infection and hence resulted in the removal the peritoneal dialysis catheter and dialysis modality change. TEXT: Introduction Gram-negative organism peritonitis is a severe complication encountered in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, often causing high morbidity and mortality. The healthcare providers involved in the care of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis should recognize that unusual organisms could cause peritonitis. We report the case of a 42-year-old male on peritoneal dialysis presenting with Citrobacter freundii peritonitis. Citrobacter freundii (C. freundii) is a motile, facultative anaerobe, non-sporing gram-negative bacilli colonize in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other animals. It is also found in water, soil, and food.1 Werkman and Gillen discovered genus Citrobacter in 1932 and the organism uses citrate a sole carbon source for the energy source and hence derives its name.2 C. freundii is hydrogen sulfide positive, indole negative, adonitol negative, and malonate negative in character.3 Peritonitis from gram-negative organisms frequently results in hospitalization, catheter loss, dialysis modality change, and mortality. These infections are hard to treat because of biofilm formation, which makes them less susceptible to antibiotics.
