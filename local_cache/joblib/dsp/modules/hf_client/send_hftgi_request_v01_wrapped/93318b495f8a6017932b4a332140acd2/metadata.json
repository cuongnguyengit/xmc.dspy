ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The right and left lung anatomy are similar but asymmetrical. The right lung consists of three lobes, and the left lung consists of two lobes. Our study is unique because of discovering a very rare morphological feature of the left lung which has not been reported yet. By the way, we compared two different available chemical agents for pleurodesis (talc and bleomycin) according to side effects, complications, and pneumothorax recurrence. METHODS We reported a case of bilateral primary spontaneous pneumothorax, who underwent talc slurry and bleomycin pleurodesis at right and left side retrospectively, and then complicate with left-sided recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, so underwent open thoracotomy and was surprisingly and accidentally found to have 4 lobes and 3 fissures in left lung. CONCLUSIONS In our case report, there were one main oblique fissure and two accessory fissures which divided the lung into 4 separated lobes, and this discovery in human's and other animals' lung anatomy has not been previously reported. In our case study, the talc slurry was more effective in preventing spontaneous pneumothorax recurrence, but with more side effects than bleomycin. We could hypothesize that the morphological variation of the lung might affect spontaneous pneumothorax development and recurrence. TEXT: pmcIntroduction The right and left lung anatomy are similar but asymmetrical. The right lung consists of three lobes: the right upper lobe (RUL), the right middle lobe (RML), and the right lower lobe (RLL). The right lobe is divided by an oblique and horizontal fissure, where the horizontal fissure divides the upper and middle lobe, and the oblique fissure divides the middle and lower lobes. The left lung consists of two lobes: the left upper lobe (LUL) and the left lower lobe (LLL). In the left lobe, there is only an oblique fissure that separates the upper and lower lobe [1]. Lobation varies greatly among species.
