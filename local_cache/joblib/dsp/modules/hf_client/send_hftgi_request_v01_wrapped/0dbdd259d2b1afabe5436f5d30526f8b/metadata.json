ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND There is a lack of information about a mixed type of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) after heart transplantation (HTx) with no amiodarone treatment in almost 1 year. Frequent ventricular extrasystoles (VES) associated with a mixed type of AIT can often be treated using thiamazole and prednisolone, without the need for specific antiarrhythmic treatment. METHODS We present a clinical case of a 65-year-old heart transplanted male patient with frequent VES associated with mixed type of AIT. Recipient had managed with amiodarone prior to HTx but there were no indications for it after the surgery. One year after antiarrhythmic treatment was discontinued, monomorphic VES (total amount: 27 472/day) were diagnosed. In addition, our investigation revealed that thyrotoxicosis developed. Prednisolone and thiamazole were added to the treatment with positive outcomes. The antithyroid treatment had been discontinued after 9 months and results of the 24-h Holter electrocardiogram monitoring showed only two VES/24 h. CONCLUSIONS The case highlights the association of amiodarone, thyroid disorders, and VES. In mixed type AIT or if diagnosis is uncertain, it is reasonable to use mixed therapy. Next is to decide whether you need special treatment for VES. There was no evidence of ventricular tachycardia. Thyroid function tests remained normal off antithyroid medications and the total amount of VES significantly decreased. There were no indications for any antiarrhythmic treatment or ablation. TEXT: Learning points In patients who have been treated with amiodarone prior to heart transplantation, should be periodically screened for thyroid disorders to promptly diagnosed delayed onset amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction. It is important to consider the mixed type of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis in borderline cases. Introduction Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction develops in 15\u201320% of patients under amiodarone therapy.1 Two main forms of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) may occur: Type 1 is a form of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism occurring in patients with underlying thyroid abnormalities, and Type 2 is a destructive thyroiditis mainly due to direct cytotoxic effects of amiodarone on thyroid follicular cells of a normal thyroid gland.2 At the same time, AIT Type 2 generally develops in patients without clinical, biochemical, and morphological evidence of thyroid disease.3 One study showed that despite discontinuation of amiodarone treatment at the time of the heart transplantation (HTx) procedure, patients remain at risk for developing mixed thyroid disease. Heart transplanted recipients treated with amiodarone before HTx should, therefore, be monitored carefully for a development of thyroid dysfunction, especially within the first post-transplant year.4 Timeline\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596521.6173522}
