ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Primary pituitary lymphoma (PPL) is an extremely rare disease with poor prognosis. Although PPL has been shown to be different from classical primary central nervous system lymphoma because of the embryological origin of structures, individual and precise treatment of PPL remains unknown. A 61-year-old man and a 65-year-old woman both diagnosed with primary pituitary diffuse large B cell lymphoma underwent genetic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and tumor tissue by next generation sequencing. In the first case, partial remission was achieved following R\u00b2-MTX chemotherapy. In the other case with TP53 mutation and BCL6-LPP fusion, disease progressed although different chemotherapy regimens were given. The gene mutation of TP53 and BCL6 may be identified as a marker responsible for prognostic difference in patients with PPL. Genetic analysis may provide a novel approach for precise management and prognosis prediction. TEXT: Introduction Primary pituitary lymphoma (PPL) is an extremely rare clinical entity with much poorer prognosis, while it has an emerging trend these years (1, 2). It is commonly limited in the sellar and parasellar areas without systematic involvement. Histologically, B-cell lymphoma is the most common cell type, followed by T cell type and NK/T cell type (1). The diagnosis of PPL usually can only be determined by pathological analysis since the clinical history, radiological findings and physical examinations do not show significant distinctions with other intracranial neoplasms (1). Although previous studies tend to consider PPL as different primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) because of embryological origin, the treatment of PPL often follows the management protocol of PCNSL. However, we noticed that the sensitivity and effectiveness of treatment varied in the patients of PPL (3\u20135). Genetic analysis might provide a novel approach to selecting the most appropriate regimen and predicting the prognosis of PPL patients. Here we reported two cases of PPL undergoing genetic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and tumor tissue by next generation sequencing (NGS). We firstly found that the gene mutation of TP53 and BCL6 might be responsible for prognostic difference in patients with PPL.
