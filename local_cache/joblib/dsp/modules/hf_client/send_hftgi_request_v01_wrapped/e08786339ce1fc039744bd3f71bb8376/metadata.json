ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: A 77-year-old man with past medical history of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) on rituximab and prednisone, presented to the hospital with worsening cough and shortness of breath. He had tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection by nasal swab polymerase chain reaction (PCR) while asymptomatic, 6 weeks earlier. He started with cough and shortness of breath 2 weeks after his initial positive test. After developing symptoms, he tested negative twice by nasal swab PCR, but the PCR of his bronchioloalveolar lavage was positive for SARS-CoV-2. He did not develop antibodies against coronavirus. Prednisone 15 mg daily was continued, and he received remdesivir, and convalescent plasma with quick recovery. We reviewed the literature to search for similar cases. Our case suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients on rituximab may have an atypical presentation and the diagnosis may be delayed due to negative PCR testing in the nasal swab. Patients may benefit from treatment with convalescent plasma. TEXT: Introduction The extent to which immunosuppressive therapy poses a risk for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is still debatable [1]. Due to the development of cytokine storm syndrome in severe COVID-19 cases, steroids and certain immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive medications have been postulated to assist in reversal and recovery [2]. The safety of rituximab in patients with COVID-19 is unclear, and controversy exists whether patients treated with rituximab present with less severe or more profound manifestations [3]. Treatment with a monoclonal antibody cocktail or high-titer convalescent plasma may be beneficial in non-hospitalized and hospitalized non-intubated patients, respectively [4, 5]. We present a patient with a past medical history of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) on prednisone and rituximab, who initially tested positive for COVID-19 while asymptomatic. He later presented with cough and shortness of breath with negative repeat testing for COVID-19, posing a diagnostic dilemma. We conducted an extensive review of the literature for patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases on rituximab who presented with COVID-19 infection. Our case resembles and mirrors those reporting an atypical and delayed course of COVID-19 infection in patients on rituximab.
