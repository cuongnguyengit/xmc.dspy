ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) is a rare, genetic autoinflammatory condition associated with NLRP3 gene mutations, causing upregulated innate immunity. CAPS manifests as systemic inflammation, causing a constellation of symptoms on a clinical spectrum of phenotypical severity: Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome being the mildest, Muckle-Wells Syndrome moderate, and Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease the most severe, with phenotype spectrum overlap. The treatment in Australia for CAPS is interleukin-1 blockade with receptor antagonist, anakinra. We describe the case of a 46-year-old female with CAPS who presented to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain. Sigmoidoscope revealed severe colitis with deep ulceration, which did not respond to hydrocortisone and azathioprine and was ultimately resolved by infliximab rescue therapy, maintained in combination with anakinra. TEXT: Introduction Cryopyrin\u2010associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) is a rare, genetic autoinflammatory condition associated with mutations in the NLRP3 gene that result in NLRP3 inflammasome\u2010mediated hyperactivation of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1\u03b2 and interleukin 18. Systemic inflammation results in a constellation of symptoms on a clinical spectrum of phenotypical severity, which has defined Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS) as the mildest, Muckle\u2010Wells Syndrome (MWS) as moderate, and Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) as the most severe, with some phenotype overlap on this spectrum. 1 Incidence is estimated at 1\u20133 per million; however, the multisystemic nature of CAPS means patients experience significant delays in diagnosis or misdiagnosis. Symptoms are generally described as nonpruritic urticaria\u2010like rash (with cold exposure activation in FCAS), fever, arthralgia, myalgia, headaches, fatigue, and ocular involvement for all CAPS. Migraine, sensorineural hearing loss, and increased risk of amyloidosis occur in MWS and NOMID. Bone (especially knee) deformities and neurological impairment occur in NOMID. 1 While inflammatory bowel disease has not been widely reported to be a feature of CAPS, NLRP3 has been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease. 2 Evidence suggests that anti\u2010tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy for CAPS patients may be effective where interleukin 1 (IL\u20101) blockade alone does not completely manage symptoms. 1 However, concerns have been raised about potential harm from this combination.
