ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) has a high recurrence rate and is likely refractory to systemic chemotherapy. The long-term outcomes and responses to immunotherapy and retreatment regimen after tumor recurrence for such cases had not yet been well-documented. Here we report a unique case of long-term follow-up with a 67-year-old woman, who was diagnosed with advanced UTUC, received radical nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff, and was refractory to chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine. Positive PD-L1 expression and somatic mutation of Ser249Cys in FGFR3 were identified in the tumor tissue. The patient then received pembrolizumab monotherapy and achieved complete response (CR) after 6 cycles of treatment. She discontinued pembrolizumab treatment thereafter but remained in CR for 3 years and 7 months until the recurrence of tumor in the right mid-ureter. The patient was then retreated with a combination of pembrolizumab and erdafitinib, and achieved CR again after the third cycle of treatment. We reported here a rare case of UTUC with concurrent pathogenic mutations in FGFR3 and TP53 with positive PD-L1 expression. The patient archived exceptional therapeutic responses to PD-1 blockade treatment and retreatment with combination of pembrolizumab and erdafitinib. Our results provide new insight into the duration of immunotherapy and the retreatment strategy after tumor recurrence based on individual genomic profiles.
