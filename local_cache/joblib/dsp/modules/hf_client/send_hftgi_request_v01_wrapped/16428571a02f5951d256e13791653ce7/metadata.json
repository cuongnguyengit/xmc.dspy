ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Antibodies targeting the PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 immune checkpoint axis have been used in a variety of tumor types. They achieve anti-tumor activity through activating the patient's own immune system to target immune response evading cancer cells. However, this unique mechanism of action may cause immune-related adverse events, irAEs. One of these irAEs is myocarditis which is associated with an alarming mortality rate. In this study we presented clinical cases of myocarditis from safety trial datasets submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA. Additionally, we analyzed over fourteen million FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, FAERS, submissions. The statistical analysis of the FAERS data provided evidence of significantly increased reporting of myocarditis in patients administered immune checkpoint inhibitors alone, in combination with another immune checkpoint inhibitor, the kinase inhibitor axitinib, or chemotherapy, for all cancer types, when compared to patients administered chemotherapy. All combination therapies led to further increased reporting odds ratios of myocarditis. We further analyzed the occurrence of myocarditis by stratifying the reports into sub-cohorts based on specific cancer types and treatment/control groups in major cancer immunotherapy efficacy trials and confirmed the observed trend for each cohort. TEXT: Introduction The field of cancer immunotherapy has continuously gained appreciation with the success of various targeted immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Malignant cancer cells have the capacity to evade the immune system by suppressing the activation of T-cells1. This concept led to the discovery of new strategies to block the immune checkpoint breaks and re-activate the immune response1. The first immunotherapy antibody approval in 2011, ipilimumab2, targeted the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte\u2013associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4)2. Antibodies targeting the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptors, pembrolizumab and nivolumab were approved in 2014, and cemiplimab in 2018. Combination therapies, such as pembrolizumab plus axitinib and nivolumab plus ipilimumab, also received approvals for various indications. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) atezolizumab (2016), durvalumab (2017), and avelumab (2017)1 were also recently approved. The use of the checkpoint inhibitors has been linked to serious immune-related adverse events (irAEs)3 including rare but potentially fatal cardiac toxicity such as myocarditis4.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597078.6344633}
