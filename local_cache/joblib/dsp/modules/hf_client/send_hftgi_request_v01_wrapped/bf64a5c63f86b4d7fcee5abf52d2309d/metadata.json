ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

Report of a case. ABSTRACT: Endometrial cancer may disseminate through lymphatic channels to pelvic and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, through the bloodstream to the lungs, or through the peritoneal space to peritoneal surfaces. However, not all endometrial cancers involve all 3 sites for metastatic disease. METHODS A patient with large volume of symptomatic recurrence of peritoneal metastases from endometrial cancer was subjected to additional surgery and both regional and systemic chemotherapy. All aspects of her disease and its treatment were studied. The primary malignancy was treated by a laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy followed by intravaginal radiation. Large volume recurrent disease limited to the abdomen and pelvis was treated by complete cytoreductive surgery (CRS), hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) and early postoperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy (EPIC). After recovery from surgery, systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel was administered. The patient is now 25 months following treatment for recurrent cancer and free of disease. CONCLUSIONS The possibility of complete resection of recurrent endometrial cancer combined with HIPEC, EPIC and systemic chemotherapy is a treatment option for selected patients. TEXT: 1 Introduction Endometrial cancer is confined to the corpus uteri at the time of diagnosis in a large majority of patients [1,2]. Also, most of these patients are cured of disease by hysterectomy with or without pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection. Radiation therapy, usually recommended in the past, is less frequently or not used at all [3]. Combination chemotherapy is increasingly used by systemic administration. A regional (intraperitoneal chemotherapy) treatment has seldom been used in the past. This lack of enthusiasm for a regional route of administration may be questioned in that the most common sites of disease dissemination in patients thought to have uterine-confine disease is the peritoneal space. Positive peritoneal cytology was documented in 12%, 5% had adnexal involvement and 6% had gross intraperitoneal metastases [4]. These patients with early peritoneal disease at the time of primary resection will most commonly fail treatment within the peritoneal cavity [5]. Therapies may be individualized by determining the most likely sites for metastatic disease documented by careful follow-up [6].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597119.6691446}
