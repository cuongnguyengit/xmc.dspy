ABSTRACT: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon and life-threating condition characterized by major immune activation and massive cytokine production by mononuclear inflammatory cells, due to defects in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. It is even more unusual in renal transplant recipients, in which it is often associated with uncontrolled infection. The mortality is high in HLH and differential diagnosis with sepsis is a challenge. The approach and management depend on the underlying trigger and comorbidities. We report a case of a 50-year-old renal transplant female admitted with fever and malaise 3 months post-transplant and presenting anemia, fever, hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of serum ferritin, and positive CMV antigenemia. Urine was positive for decoy cells and BKV-DNA. Graft biopsy showed CMV nephritis. Both blood and urine cultures where positive for E. coli. Hemophagocytosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone, with complete response after 3 weeks. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of a rare and serious condition in a renal transplant patient, which can allow a favorable clinical course and improve survival rate. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) consists of an immune hyperactivation syndrome that takes place when NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to eliminate activated macrophages, leading to over production of proinflammatory cytokines1. There are primary and acquired causes. Primary HLH is rare and typically manifests in childhood because of two autosomal recessive defects in genes that encode proteins involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules during apoptosis in natural killer (NK) cells.1 , 2Acquired (secondary) HLH is triggered by various conditions as infections, immunodeficiency, rheumatologic diseases, and cancer.1 , 3 , 4 Infection is the most common precipitating factor of HLH in adults, mainly viruses of herpes family (EBV, CMV, HSV, HHV8), but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens can also be a trigger.5 , 6 Multiorgan involvement and organomegaly are frequently found and hemophagocytosis results in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of HLH is based on the presence of at least 5 of the following 8 criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting \u2265 2 lineages of peripheral blood cells), hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, serum ferritin >500 ng/mL, low activity of NK cells, soluble CD25 > 2.400 U/mL and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes.7 Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red cells, platelets, or white cells in macrophage cytoplasm visualized in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.2 The syndrome is defined by a complex picture. However, some patients may have incipient or partial disease.1 Most diagnostic\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: To compare long-term efficacy and safety of immunotherapeutic strategies as maintenance to prevent disease relapses of generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) in real-world settings. This is a retrospective cohort study on generalized MG conducted in seven major neurological centers across China. Eligible participants were patients with generalized MG who were under minimal manifestation status or better. Main outcome measures were probability of patients free of relapses and causes of drug discontinuation. Among 1064 patients enrolled, the median (interquartile range) age was 50.3 (37.0-62.5) years and 641 (60.2%) were women. Disease relapse was significantly lower for rituximab (6.1%) compared with all the other monotherapies (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06 to 0.56, P = .0030). As combination therapies, tacrolimus in combination with corticosteroids reduced risk of disease relapses compared with azathioprine with corticosteroids (HR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.81, P = .0077) or mycophenolate mofetil with corticosteroids (HR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.67, P = .0020). Otherwise, lower-dose corticosteroids or azathioprine as monotherapy significantly increased risk of disease relapses (HR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.94 to 3.99, P < .0001; HR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.23, P = .0003, respectively). The proportion of discontinuation was lowest in patients with rituximab (20.4%) as monotherapy and tacrolimus with corticosteroids (23.6%). Overall, combination treatment of immunosuppressants with corticosteroids had a lower rate of discontinuation compared with corresponding monotherapy (HR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.71, P < .0001). Rituximab as monotherapy and tacrolimus with corticosteroids displayed better clinical efficacy as well as drug maintenance to prevent disease relapses in patients with generalized MG. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoantibody\u2010mediated autoimmune disorder against postsynaptic membrane proteins at the neuromuscular junction, including acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle\u2010specific kinase (MuSK), and lipoprotein receptor\u2010related protein 4 (LRP4). 1 The bulk of generalized MG therapy include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for symptomatic management as well as immunotherapeutic agents to inhibit autoimmunity. Most patients with generalized MG require induction therapy with glucocorticosteroids (steroids), or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), plasma exchange (PE) for severe cases. And immunosuppressants are frequently used for maintenance. A repertoire of classical immunosuppressants, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus have also been adopted. 2 , 3 Some efficacy of an anti\u2010CD20 B\u2010cell depleting agent, rituximab, is demonstrated by sustained clinical improvement with prolonged time to relapse and reduce the need of other immunosuppressants. 4 , 5 , 6 , 7\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596028.4450347}
