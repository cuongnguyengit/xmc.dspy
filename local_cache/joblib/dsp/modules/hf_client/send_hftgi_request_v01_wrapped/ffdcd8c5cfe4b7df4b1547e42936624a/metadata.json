ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Bisphosphonates and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand inhibitors are currently the most widely used antiresorptive therapies in bone metabolism diseases treatment. Unfortunately they can evoke medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws. The present case series study proposes to evaluate clinical features, evolution and the surgical therapeutic approaches in three patients affected by medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw and to review the state of art regarding the management of this complication in light of the most recent literature. Three cases of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws are discussed, two related to bisphosphonates therapy (ibandronic acid) and one due to denosumab. All three patients were aged female and had probably a dental trigger agent. The lesions located in posterior mandible were treated in one case with the surgical approach alone and, in the other case, with surgical approach associated with Erb-YAG laser. The lesion related to denosumab was treated with surgical approach and platelet rich fibrin application. A complete healing was always achieved. Dentists should be aware of the potential risk of developing medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws for patients who take or had taken antiresorptive drugs. The side effects of denosumab and bisphosphonates are partly overlapping and currently there is still no consensus about the therapeutic surgical options. Prevention and early detection of the lesions should be the primary strategy. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ) is a severe bone disease related to various medicaments: antiresorptive drugs (including bisphosphonates and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand [RANKL] inhibitors) and antiangiogenic drugs [1]. Osteoclasts activity is depressed by antiresorptive agents, therefore, bone resorption is inhibited. Among these agents bisphosphonates, denosumab and selective estrogen modulators are the most used, rather than hormone replacement therapy and calcictonin which are mostly abandoned [2]. Typical and frequent indications for the use of these drugs are postmenopausal osteoporosis, bone malignant lesions secondary to breast or prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma [3].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597105.491206}
