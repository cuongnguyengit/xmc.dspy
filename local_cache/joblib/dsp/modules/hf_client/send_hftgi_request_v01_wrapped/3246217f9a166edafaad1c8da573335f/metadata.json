ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: Anthracyclines constitute the backbone of intensive adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy. Cardiotoxicity is one of its most serious adverse effects, and its incidence increases with cumulative dose. Dexrazoxane is a cardioprotective agent used in conjunction with anthracycline therapy. There is limited data of its usage in adult AML patients. We report the outcomes of six older adults at high risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity who received dexrazoxane during induction/re-induction therapy. Five had preserved left-ventricular function while two proceeded onto stem-cell transplantation. Additional investigation of dexrazoxane in adult leukemia therapy is warranted, particularly in older patients at highest risk for cardiovascular mortality. TEXT: 1 Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for 80% of acute leukemia in adults with a median age at diagnosis of 65 years [1]. The standard upfront induction regimen for fit adult individuals remains \u201c7+3\u201d, consisting of 7 days of continuous infusion cytarabine and 3 days of an anthracycline, either daunorubicin or idarubicin [2]. Variations of induction and re-induction regimens in the refractory/relapsed disease setting often include either idarubicin or mitoxantrone in conjunction with high dose cytarabine and sometimes purine analogues. Medical comorbidities, specifically cardiovascular morbidity, have been shown to negatively impact the clinical outcomes of AML induction therapy in older adults. Cardiotoxicity constitutes the most frequently feared adverse event associated with the use of anthracyclines (>10%), and compromised cardiac function may compromise the use of potentially curative upfront and subsequent AML regimens in a patient's course. Prevention or mitigation of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, particularly in older adults who constitute the majority of new AML diagnoses, is therefore an area of tremendous clinical relevance. Cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines is dose-dependent and can occur at any time in the treatment course with acute, subacute, and late-onset presentations. Clinical symptoms include arrhythmias, myopericarditis, cardiomyopathy, and congestive heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [3], [4], [5]. For example, the incidence of cardiotoxic events with use of doxorubicin was less than 5% at a cumulative dose of 400 mg/m2, but increased in a dose-dependent manner to 16% at a cumulative dose of 500 mg/m2, 26% at 550 mg/m2, and 48% at 700 mg/m2\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596608.8834476}
