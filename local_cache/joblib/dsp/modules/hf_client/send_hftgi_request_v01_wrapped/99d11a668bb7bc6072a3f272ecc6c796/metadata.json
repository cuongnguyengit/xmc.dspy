ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: To report the case of a patient with refractory chronic eosinophilic pneumonia who developed rheumatoid arthritis during anti-interleukin (IL)-5 therapy. The case of a 66-year-old male ex-smoker with allergic rhinitis who had dyspnea and chronic cough for 6 months and who was ultimately diagnosed with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is reported. Long-term corticosteroid therapy was necessary due to recurrence of the chronic eosinophilic pneumonia during tapering of the corticosteroid. As a steroid sparing strategy, mepolizumab was initiated, and the steroid was tapered gradually. When the dose of prednisolone was 2 mg/day, he developed polyarthralgia. Mepolizumab was changed to benralizumab considering the possibility that arthralgia was a side effect of mepolizumab; however, the arthralgia continued and he was ultimately diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. Methotrexate was initiated and his arthritis improved. Thereafter, benralizumab was discontinued after 5 injections, and he subsequently required neither systemic corticosteroids nor biologics. The present case may suggest that suppression of IL-5 induces rheumatoid arthritis in certain patients; however, it is also possible that initial steroid therapy improved subclinical RA and made it remain undiagnosed, and the parallel OCS tapering during IL-5 therapy could have contributed to unveil the underlying RA. Further studies are required to establish guidelines on the optimum use of anti-IL-5 therapy and to understand the interactions between chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, anti-IL-5 therapy, tapering of corticosteroid and development of rheumatoid arthritis. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Humanized monoclonal antibody to interleukin-5 (IL-5; mepolizumab) or the \u03b1-chain of the IL-5 receptor (benralizumab) is effective treatment for eosinophilic asthma, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP), and other eosinophilic diseases.1 However, development of arthritis is a potential concern given that the consequent suppression of allergic Th2 cytokines would shift the cytokine balance toward Th1- and Th17-associated responses, which can lead to various inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA).2 Here, we describe the case of a patient with CEP who was treated with long-term oral glucocorticoid and developed RA during anti-IL-5 therapy and tapering of the glucocorticoid. Initial corticosteroid treatment might have suppressed RA symptom to make it remained undiagnosed and tapering of corticosteroid might help unmasking RA. Further investigation is needed to understand the role of anti-IL-5 therapy in the development of RA.
