ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Non-tuberculous mycobacterial pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) may simulate Pulmonary Tuberculosis (PTB) in its clinical and radiological expression posing a diagnostic dilemma and challenge to the treating physician, especially in high TB prevalent countries. Though recent emerging data indicates inter-human transmission, infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) is commonly acquired from the environmental sources [1]. NTM can produce disease not only in immunocompromised populations but also in healthy individuals leading to significant morbidity and mortality [2]. Unlike PTB, NTM-PD is usually difficult to confirm and speciate in resource limited clinical settings and high TB endemic countries due to non-availability, poor accessibility and affordability to a specific culture facility. Apart from diagnostic challenges, adverse drug effects with treatment leading to non-adherence are another vexing problem. We present here case descriptions of four patients of NTM-PD, confirmed by culture isolates, one was a rapid grower and the other three were slow growers. All four patients were treated with available guideline-based treatment protocols and followed up. TEXT: pmc1 Introduction NTM are environmental opportunistic organisms found in the soil, dust and water including its natural resources. Yet, NTM-PD is caused by relatively few species of NTM [3]. NTM represent about 190 species and subspecies and can produce disease in humans of all ages [4]. Worldwide, various population-based data and studies indicate a high and increasing prevalence of NTM-PD. Improved diagnostics and laboratory methodologies along with increased awareness among physicians might be contributory for the higher prevalence reported. Pulmonary disease (PD) is the most common clinical presentation of NTM infection accounting for 80 to 90% of all NTM-associated diseases [5]. The annual prevalence rate of NTM-PD varies in different regions ranging from 0.2 to 9.8/100,000 population. This may not reflect the true prevalence due to lack of consistent reporting and NTM infection not being notifiable in many countries. Period prevalence in studies including all ages was between 9 and 41/100,000. In all studies, Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) was the most common (64%\u201385% of cases) cause of NTM-PD [6], [7].Table 1 Clinical Profile of The Study Subjects.
