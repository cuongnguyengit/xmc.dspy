ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: A 31-year-old woman, who had been diagnosed with craniopharyngioma (CP) at the age of 13, suffered secondary hypopituitarism after two surgical resections of CP, receiving supplement of levothyroxine, cortisone, and sequential estrogen and progesterone because of primary amenorrhea. She managed to conceive after ovulation induction with human menopausal gonadotropin. Luteal phase deficiency (LPD) was found during the first trimester, as the progesterone stayed at a low level between 0.07 and 1.63 ng/ml within seven gestational weeks, followed by a gradual rise from 4.01 up to 34.70 ng/ml in the 11th week, which was mainly secreted by the placenta. Estrogen and progesterone were administered to the patient as luteal support until the 12th week, who succeeded in delivering a healthy baby at term. In conclusion, the patient with hypopituitarism who develops severe LPD during the early pregnancy may need luteal support until 12th week. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Craniopharyngioma (CP) is one of the rare embryonic malformations in the sellar and parasellar area, in which the quality of life is frequently impaired in the long\u2010term survivors due to the sequelae caused by the anatomical proximity of the tumor to the optic nerve/chiasma and hypothalamic\u2010pituitary axes.1 The endocrine dysfunction of pituitary impairment or loss and subsequent hypopituitarism usually occurs, especially after CP resection, with an incidence up to 78%\u2013100%.2 Gonadotropin\u2010releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle\u2010stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid\u2010stimulating hormone (TSH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone all decrease significantly in hypopituitarism; therefore, a diagnose of any hormone deficiency and an appropriate replacement are within the disease\u2010specific considerations for CP.3 True, secondary hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) always leads to amenorrhea and infertility. A few cases of successful pregnancy following CP resection have been reported.4 As the German cross\u2010sectional study reported in 2018, 79 patients were followed up for 15 years with regard to growth hormone substitution therapy, and only 11 (13.9%) got married and 2 (2.5%) conceived or had children.5 A recent review summarized six successful pregnancies after CP resection.6 However, there have been few reports on luteal phase deficiency (LPD) and luteal support during pregnancy after the ovulation induction in the CP patients.6 LPD is a condition of progesterone not sufficient enough to maintain a normal secretory endometrium and to allow for normal embryo implantation and growth.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597084.4847612}
