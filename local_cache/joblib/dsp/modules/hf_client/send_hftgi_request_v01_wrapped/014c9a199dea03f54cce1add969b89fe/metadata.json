ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \u201cI think I\u2019m having a stroke.\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient. We will first look for any mention of medication in the article. Then, we will check for any symptoms or conditions that could be caused by the medication. Finally, we will confirm with the article if the medication was the cause of the symptoms.\\nReactions: hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, pseudo-prolonged QT interval, ST depression, T-U wave fusion, QU interval, absent T wave\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Hypotension associated to a bilateral quadratus lumborum block performed for post-operative analgesia in an open aortic surgery case. ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE Bilateral quadratus lumborum block has been described for major abdominal procedures when sepsis is present, because risks associated to epidural are considered elevated. In an open aortic surgery, a single-shot bilateral quadratus lumborum block type 1 may be an alternative to thoracic epidural block for post-operative analgesia in a patient having an increased cumulative risk for thoracic epidural hematoma. METHODS A 56-year-old female patient presenting controlled hypertension, chronic renal disease stage 3b, dyslipidemia and a platelet count of 102,000/\u03bcl, and taking aspirin, was scheduled for bilateral aortoiliac endarterectomy. She was submitted to a sole general anesthesia plus, at end of the surgery, a bilateral quadratus lumborum block type 1 for post-operative analgesia with 20mL of ropivacaine 0.5%, per side, before extubation. Immediately after post anesthesia care unit admission, patient developed moderate hypotension (dopamine infusion was needed during 18h), concomitantly with a rapid reduction in the pain scores. Low numeric rating scale and opioid consumption were noted, particularly in the first 24h post-operatively. CONCLUSIONS Quadratus lumborum block was an effective analgesic technique for open aortic surgery in this case, although hypotension associated to bilateral quadratus lumborum block type 1 may occur. Associated sympathetic block probably related to the bilateral paravertebral extension of the block, may contribute for post-operative hypotension associated to reperfusion-ischemia syndrome in a patient that had long-lasting intraoperative aortic cross-clamping. The use of high concentration of local anesthetic to obtain longer duration of action of a single-shot quadratus lumborum block to avoid thoracic epidural or bilateral quadratus lumborum block catheterization should be used judiciously. TEXT: pmcIntroduction We describe a bilateral Quadratus Lumborum Block Type 1 (QLB1) for post-operative analgesia in an open aortic surgery case, as an alternative to thoracic epidural block in a patient presenting an increased cumulative risk for epidural hematoma. QLB1 blocks T6 to L1 dermatomes, at least, thus having the potential to cover the entire sensitive innervation of the abdominal wall and, differently from other TAP blocks; they also block visceral afferent pathways to the spinal cord, through the paravertebral extension of the blockade. These techniques may be very important in major abdominal vascular surgery in selected patients, but the risks associated to bilateral extension of the paravertebral blockade may exist. A written consent from the patient for publication was obtained.
