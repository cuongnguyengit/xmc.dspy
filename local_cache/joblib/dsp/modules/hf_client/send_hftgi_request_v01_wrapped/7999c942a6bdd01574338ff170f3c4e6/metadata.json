ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a CD30 + lymphoproliferative disorder that may manifest with skin involvement.1 We present a rare case of Agent Orange-induced ALCL with cutaneous involvement of the hand, surgical excision, and follow-up treatment. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION Anaplastic large\u2010cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a CD30 + lymphoproliferative disorder that can involve the skin. The characteristics of primary and secondary ALCL include raised red skin lesions, nodules, or tumors. 1 More than 3 million Americans served in the Vietnam War. Some of them were exposed to defoliant chemicals, including Agent Orange. Lasting health effects are known to be caused by these exposures, including types of cancer. This case study presents a bizarre case of Agent Orange\u2010induced ALCL and reviews the presentation, surgical excision, and follow\u2010up treatment that was involved. 2 2 CASE PRESENTATION A 63\u2010year\u2010old right\u2010hand dominant man initially presented in 2010 to his primary care physician (PCP) with a one\u2010centimeter erythematous raised lesion on his right palm. He reported that he was in his usual health until three weeks ago when he noticed a point of irritation on the palmar aspect of his right hand. It began to form into a mass with increased sensitivity. It had a rapid onset from the time it was first apparent as it increased to the size of a silver dollar with increasing sensitivity over the course of three weeks, according to the patient. On presentation, there was no preceding trauma to the area\u2014although the patient worked with his hands and acknowledged the possibility for an implanted foreign body that he could not specifically recall. His past medical history is significant for hypertension and hyperlipidemia with a myocardial infarction in 2007; however, this did not require bypass or stenting. Additionally, he presented with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, benign prostate hypertrophy, and noninsulin\u2010dependent diabetes mellitus. The patient's family history was notable only for one case of lung cancer. He is married and a Vietnam War veteran where his service duties included preparing aircraft for flight. He is a previous smoker, having quit three years ago after a 30 pack\u2010year smoking history. He does not use alcohol, illicit substances, or over\u2010the\u2010counter supplements. His medications at that time were as follows: Latanoprost 2.5ml both eyes, Tamsulosin 0.4mg QHS, pravastatin 40mg, metoprolol 25mg BID, acetylsalicylic acid 81mg, Omeprazole 20mg, and metformin 500mg daily. He reported allergy to Avodart and Simvastatin.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597130.7985892}
