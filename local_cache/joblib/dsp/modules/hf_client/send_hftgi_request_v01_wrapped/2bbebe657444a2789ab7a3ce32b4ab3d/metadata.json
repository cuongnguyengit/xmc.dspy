ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: (1) Background: We investigated survival outcomes following first-line chemotherapy before and after approval of bevacizumab (Bev) for ovarian cancer in Japan to evaluate the efficacy of Bev for advanced clear cell carcinoma (CCC). (2) Methods: We investigated 28 consecutive patients diagnosed with CCC (stages III/IV) at our hospital between 2008 and 2018. Bev was administered for treatment of advanced CCC after approval in Japan in November 2013. Progression-free survival (PFS) was compared between 10 patients treated before Bev approval (2008-2013, Bev- group) and 18 patients treated after Bev approval (2014-2018, Bev+ group) for first-line chemotherapy. (3) Results: No intergroup difference was observed in patient characteristics. The rate of completeness of resection was higher in the Bev - group (9/10, 90%) than in the Bev+ group (15/18, 83%) (p = 0.044). Eleven (61%) patients in the Bev + group received \u2265 21 cycles of Bev. The median PFS increased from 12.0 months before Bev approval to 29.8 months after Bev approval (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.026). Multivariate analysis showed that performance status (p = 0.049), Bev administration (p = 0.023) and completeness of resection (p = 0.023) were independent prognostic factors for PFS. (4) Conclusions: Bev incorporated into first-line chemotherapy might improve PFS in patients with advanced CCC. We hope that our findings will be confirmed in adequate clinical trials. TEXT: 1. Introduction Clear cell carcinoma (CCC), a subtype of epithelial ovarian carcinoma, is rare in Europe and the United States [1]; however, it accounts for 20\u201330% of epithelial ovarian tumors in Asia, particularly in Japan [2,3]. Many CCCs are often diagnosed at an early stage, and advanced disease is uncommon. The Japanese Gynecologic Oncology Group (JGOG) 3017/Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) trial [4] reported that advanced CCC was diagnosed in only 156/667 patients (23.3%). CCC shows a poorer prognosis than high-grade serous carcinoma [1,3,5], particularly in patients with advanced-stage disease because it is less sensitive to conventional platinum-based chemotherapy [2,5,6,7]. Reportedly, paclitaxel-containing platinum chemotherapy was more effective than conventional platinum chemotherapy for advanced CCC [8]. However, no cytotoxic regimen more effective than paclitaxel and carboplatin has been reported in the available literature [4]. Therefore, therapeutic strategies for advanced CCC are urgently warranted.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597119.6685946}
