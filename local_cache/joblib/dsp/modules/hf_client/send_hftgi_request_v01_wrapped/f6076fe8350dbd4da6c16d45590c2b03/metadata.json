ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Strongyloides and hookworms co-infection in a liver transplant patient. ABSTRACT: We here present a female patient who is a recipient of liver transplantation from a cadaveric donor. She developed abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea for two weeks of duration, after four months of the transplant. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and stool analysis for ova and parasite showed Necator americanus / Ancylostoma duodenale (Hookworm) ova /larvae and Strongyloides stercoralis Larvae. She had a dramatic clinical response to Ivermectin and Albendazole combination, which was given until the clearance of her stool exam. She was discharged from the hospital in good condition, and her infection is considered as a donor-derived transmission of these parasites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of Strongyloides stercoralis and hookworm co-infection in a liver transplant patient. Parasitic infection should be considered in the differential diagnosis of diarrheal illness of cadaveric transplant patients, even if it is not prevalent in the region. TEXT: Introduction Strongyloides stercoralis and hookworms are parasitic intestinal nematodes that belong to the group of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) [1]. Strongyloides stercoralis had significant morbidity but are mostly neglected, while Hookworm causes public health burden among Soil-transmitted helminths but non-endemic in our area. Both parasites have the same infection route, i.e., skin penetration [1]. Hookworm is one of the most common roundworms of humans, and infection is caused by the nematode parasites Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale. Hookworm infections usually occur in areas where human feces are used as fertilizer or where defecation onto soil happens [2]. Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus, are worldwide in areas with warm, moist climates and are widely overlapping. Necator americanus was widespread in the Southeastern United States until the early 20th century [2]. We describe an unusual case of an immunocompromised patient (liver transplant recipient) presenting with GI symptoms found later to have parasitic Co-infection. Case presentation A 53-year-old Kuwaiti female, known case of Diabetes mellites, Ulcerative colitis, and liver cirrhosis due to Autoimmune liver disease, undergone a successful cadaveric liver transplant from a Bangladesh-born donor. The patient's immunosuppressive regimen after transplant consisted of Mycophenolate Mofetil, Tacrolimus, and Prednisolone. No other details from the donor were available except he was admitted as a case of motor vehicle accident then became brain dead, his hospitalization was for one week, and during this week he had been managed for his multiple trauma. The pre-transplant screening investigation did not include Strongyloides serology.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597195.838443}
