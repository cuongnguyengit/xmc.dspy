ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia is a rare immune-induced, non-metastatic neurologic syndrome, most frequently associated with gynecological cancers, which carries an abysmal prognosis. We report the case of a patient with advanced-stage uterine cancer, who developed severe pancerebellar ataxia, while in partial remission, after the completion of 3 cycles of neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy. Swift initiation of immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids combined with plasmapheresis did not result in significant clinical benefit. Early recognition of this debilitating condition and standardization of its treatment strategy are prerequisites for both improved survival outcomes and quality of life in these patients. Further studies are warranted to clarify the immune-stimulating impact of effective cytotoxic chemotherapy and the occurence of autoimmune paraneoplastic neurological syndromes. TEXT: 1 Introduction Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) affect less than 1% of oncological patients and represent neurological manifestations related to immune-mediated responses caused by the expression of onconeural antigens from the underlying solid tumor (H\u00f6ftberger et al., 2015, Braik et al., 2010). PNS usually precede the diagnosis of neoplasia or its recurrence, whereas, treatment of the underlying malignancy is considered to be the pillar of their management (Hammack et al., 1990, Blaes et al., 1999). Paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia (PCA), associated with Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody type 1 (PCA1) or Anti-Yo, is the most common among PNS (O\u2019Brien et al., 1995), usually observed in gynecological cancers (Yan et al., 2018). Herein, we present a rare case of an elderly female who developed rapidly progressive PCA during the course of effective platinum-based chemotherapy for locally advanced uterine carcinoma of serous histology. Despite the early introduction of both high dose corticosteroids and plasmapheresis her neurological symptoms deteriorated and rendered her bedridden. 2 Case presentation\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597087.3415303}
