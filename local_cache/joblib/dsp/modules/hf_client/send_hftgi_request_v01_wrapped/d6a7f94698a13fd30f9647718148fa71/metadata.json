ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: This report describes two cases of tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy secondary to incessant ectopic atrial tachycardia (EAT) in an infant presenting with severe left ventricular dysfunction and hemodynamic instability. The two cases were managed differently. The first required mechanical ventilation and was resistant to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. After the initiation of enteral ivabradine (0.15mg/kg) the heart rate slowed with significant improvement in hemodynamics, peripheral perfusion and sinus rhythm was restored after 12 hours. Ivabradine was continued and the patient was discharged home after 10 days of hospitalization. The second case was managed by early initiation of ivabradine and resulted in restoration of sinus rhythm within 4 hours, thus avoiding trials of conventional anti-arrhythmic drugs with unstable hemodynamic profile. The infant was discharged after 5 days of hospitalization on ivabradine.. TEXT: pmcINTRODUCTION Increased automaticity is the underlying mechanism of several pediatric tachyarrhythmias including EAT. Ivabradine is a selective inhibitor of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels involved in the funny current responsible for spontaneous depolarization of cardiac pacemaker cells. By inhibition of the funny current and reduction of automaticity, ivabradine represents a potential therapy for these conditions with hemodynamically neutral profile in contrast to many of the conventional antiarrhythmic drugs. Ivabradine demonstrates use dependence, resulting in a greater effect at higher heart rates. Ivabradine has been utilized so far in the literature for treatment in children with heart failure, EAT, multifocal atrial tachycardia, congenital, and postoperative junctional ectopic tachycardias.[1234567] We report here, the utility of ivabradinein two hemodynamically unstable infants with tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy secondary to EAT. The two were managed differently, with earlier utilisation of ivabradine in the second patient, having learned from the first patient.
