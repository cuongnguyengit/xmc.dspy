ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \u201cI think I\u2019m having a stroke.\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient. We will first look for any mention of medication in the article. Then, we will check for any symptoms or conditions that could be caused by the medication. Finally, we will confirm with the article if the medication was the cause of the symptoms.\\nReactions: hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, pseudo-prolonged QT interval, ST depression, T-U wave fusion, QU interval, absent T wave\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Response of conventional chondrosarcoma to gemcitabine alone: a case report. ABSTRACT: Conventional skeletal chondrosarcoma is a bone neoplasm, which is poorly sensitive to anthracyclines-based chemotherapy. We report on an 18-month-long tumour response to gemcitabine as single agent in a young patient with an advanced secondary peripheral conventional chondrosarcoma, previously treated unsuccessfully with anthracyclines, ifosfamide, platinum, etoposide. TEXT: Background The skeletal chondrosarcoma family represents a heterogeneous group of malignant bone mesenchymal tumours characterised by the production of a chondroid matrix. They are the third bone sarcoma in incidence, and the most frequent in adults. There are three main subtypes: conventional, mesenchymal, and clear-cell. A \u201cdedifferentiated\u201d chondrosarcoma develops in 10-15% of conventional chondrosarcomas, while mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a high-grade, aggressive neoplasm with a natural history and chemosensitivity that might be close to Ewing sarcoma, and clear-cell chondrosarcoma is a low-grade variant [1]. In conventional chondrosarcoma (cCS), the histological malignancy grade is the main prognostic factor [2]. Grade 1 cCS are characterised by a very low metastatic potential, and some authors have quite recently suggested a re-classification of these types as \u201catypical cartilaginous tumours\u201d [1]. Grade 2 and 3 cCS are marked by a higher metastatic potential, with a 10-year survival of 64-86% and 29-55% respectively [3,4]. CCSs are also categorised according to their location in the bone: a central chondrosarcoma onsets in the medullary cavity, a small percentage of them from a pre-existing benign lesion known as enchondroma, while a peripheral variant arises from the surface of the bone, as a result of malignant progression of a pre-existing benign (solitary or hereditary) osteochondroma. Surgery is the mainstay of the treatment of localized disease. While curettage is acceptable for grade 1 cCS, wide excision is usually required for higher grade cCS, with the exception of skull base cCS which may be treated with radiotherapy. In particular, hadrons can play an important role in the management of skull base cCS, and very good outcomes are reported [5].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient. We will first need to identify the drugs mentioned in the article, then we will look for any reported adverse reactions associated with those drugs.\\nReactions: Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, mucositis, diarrhea, constipation, fever, infection, neuropathy, rash, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, cough, edema, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, stomatitis, dysphagia, dysgeusia, dry skin, pruritus, nail changes, conjunctivitis, blurred vision\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Denosumab improves bone mineral density and microarchitecture and reduces bone pain in women with osteoporosis with and without glucocorticoid treatment. ABSTRACT: Osteoporosis is a key health problem in postmenopausal women with high social and economic impact. Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and deterioration of bone microarchitecture may occur also as a result of long-term glucocorticoid treatment (GCT) of autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. Denosumab specifically inhibits the binding of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB to its ligand, thus preventing osteoclast activation and bone resorption. The efficacy and safety of denosumab, administered subcutaneously as 60 mg, once every six months for 12 months, were evaluated in 60 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO) divided into two groups. The GCT group included 30 patients receiving concomitant glucocorticoid therapy and the non-GCT group included 30 patients that did not receive GCT. In the non-GCT group, the 12-month treatment with denosumab resulted in BMD increase of 6.1% and 2.8% in lumbar spine and hip, respectively. T-score increased by 13.1% and 5.6% in both, the lumbar spine and hip. A slight rise in the Trabecular Bone Score (TBS) of 0.3% was observed. Bone pain was markedly reduced by 56.2%. In the GCT group, denosumab therapy increased BMD with 5.8% and 2.3% in lumbar spine and hip, respectively. T-score of lumbar spine and hip significantly increased by 14.0% and 4.4%, and the TBS rose by 5%. Bone pain was reduced by 53.6%. These data confirm the available knowledge on denosumab efficacy and safety in women with PMO and also provide new insights into its therapeutic potential in patients with osteoporosis related to a long-term corticosteroid treatment. TEXT: Introduction Osteoporosis (OP) is a public health problem representing a common bone disease characterized by bone loss and structural deterioration of bone tissue. OP can lead to numerous other clinical and health-related consequences, including fracture, the need for long-term care and excess mortality. The reduced bone density associated with the disorder is a major risk factor for fracture, especially of the hip, spine and wrist.[1] OP is often referred to as a silent disease, as many individuals do not realize that they have the disease until a fracture occurs. OP-related fractures impose a heavy burden on individuals and on society, as they often lead to a variety of physical and psychological consequences, including future fractures, depression, functional impairment, pain and disability.[2] In postmenopausal osteoporosis (PMO), receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) is directly associated with osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.[3,4] Osteoprotegerin binds to RANKL and is directly involved in the regulation of the RANK-RANKL pathway.[5]\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596439.709607}
