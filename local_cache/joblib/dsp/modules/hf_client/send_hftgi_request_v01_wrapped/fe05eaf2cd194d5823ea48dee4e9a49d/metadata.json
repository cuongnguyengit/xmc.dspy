ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Gout is a rare cause of pain after total knee arthroplasty, and its presentation can be difficult to distinguish from a prosthetic joint infection. We describe a patient with left knee pain that had a history of gout and left total knee arthroplasty. Synovial fluid demonstrated monosodium urate crystals and positive alpha-defensin assay. Surgery was not pursued given a low clinical suspicion for infection and negative cultures. Her symptoms improved and ultimately resolved. There are limited case reports of periprosthetic aseptic gout flare, and only one case of concomitant positive alpha-defensin assay and monosodium urate crystals in a patient treated surgically. This case raises the possibility that patients with periprosthetic crystal arthropathy and a positive alpha-defensin test can be managed nonoperatively in the appropriate setting. TEXT: Introduction Pain after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) presents as a diagnostic challenge. Persistence of pain leads to patient dissatisfaction, with about 10% of patients reporting unhappiness with their TKA [1]. There are many causes of a painful TKA, including aseptic loosening, malalignment, instability, or prosthetic joint infection (PJI). Given its devastating complications, infection must be ruled out. While aseptic loosening and malalignment may be diagnosed on imaging, a PJI diagnosis presents more complexity as it is based on physical examination, laboratory markers, and synovial fluid aspiration results. The International Consensus Meeting (ICM) criteria include serologic, histologic, and intraoperative findings, and have become the gold standard to diagnose PJI [2]. The presence of a sinus tract or 2 positive periprosthetic cultures with the same organism are considered major criteria and diagnostic of PJI. The minor criteria incorporate a point system, with a score of <3 indicating no infection, 3-5 being inconclusive, and \u22656 indicating a PJI. An elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP, >100 mg/L in acute phase or >10 mg/L in chronic phase) or elevated D-dimer (>860 ng/mL) is given 2 points. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, >30 mm/h) is given 1 point. An elevated synovial WBC count (>10,000 cells/\u03bcl in acute phase or >3000 cells/\u03bcl in chronic phase), positive alpha-defensin (signal-to-cutoff ratio >1), or positive leukocyte esterase (++) is given 3 points. An elevated synovial polymorphonuclear percentage (>90% in acute phase or >70% in chronic phase) is given 2 points, a single positive culture is given 2 points, positive histology is given 3 points, and positive intraoperative purulence is given 3 points [2].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597076.9633725}
