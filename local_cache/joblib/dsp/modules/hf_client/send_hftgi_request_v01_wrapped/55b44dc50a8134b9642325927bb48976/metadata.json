ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Deep vein thrombosis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. However, its association with adenomatous polyposis coli is extremely rare. Here we present an interesting case of deep vein thrombosis associated with adenomatous polyposis coli. METHODS A 15 year old female who was having fever and diarrhea for 5 months developed bilateral asymmetric painful swelling of lower limbs for 1 month. Doppler ultrasound of lower limbs revealed presence of thrombosis from inferior vena cava up to popliteal vein. Colonoscopy and biopsy were suggestive of adenomatous polyposis coli. However, she could not tolerate anticoagulant therapy and was put on aspirin therapy for 6 months to which she responded well with the resolution of thrombus. CONCLUSIONS Role of aspirin therapy may be considered whenever a patient of venous thrombosis cannot tolerate anticoagulant therapy. TEXT: Venous thromboembolism is an important cause of hospital acquired morbidity and mortality (1). Its association with adenomatous polyposis coli is a rare event (2, 3). Malignancy or major operative procedure associated with colonic polyp may predispose to thromboembolic event (2). There has been previously published few reports of diarrhea associated with deep vein thrombosis (4-6). Etiology of diarrhea in those cases was unrelated to colonic polyp. However, association of deep vein thrombosis with non-malignant colonic polyp presenting with diarrhea is an extremely rare event with a report of only one case in previous English literature (3). Mainstay of therapy of deep vein thrombosis is anticoagulation. However, fatal bleeding episode following anticoagulation in our patient lead to withdrawal of anticoagulation therapy. The patient was treated successfully with low dose aspirin therapy (75mg/day) with complete resolution of thrombus. Case Presentation A 15-year-old unmarried female presented to us with complain of asymmetric onset lower limb swelling for last 1 month. The swelling initially involved the left lower limb and for last 1 week she had also developed right lower limb swelling. The swelling which was initially painless later became painful. She was also having low grade irregular fever for last 5 months along with small amount of non-foul smelling mucus containing recurrent episodes of diarrhea for the same duration along with a history of significant weight loss. She had an episode of hematochezia 1 day after admission. There was no history of abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal distension, facial puffiness, oliguria, bleeding from any other sites, joint pain, skin rash, recent contact with tuberculosis, recent surgery or prolonged immobilization. She had mild pallor and her body mass index (BMI) was 17.5 kg/mt2. She had bilateral pitting pedal edema along with raised local temperature and a positive Homans\u2019 sign and Moses\u2019 sign.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596613.2105885}
