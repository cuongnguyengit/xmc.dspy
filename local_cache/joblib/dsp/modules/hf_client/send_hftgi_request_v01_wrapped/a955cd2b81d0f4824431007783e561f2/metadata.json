ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Combined pulsed-dye laser and medical therapy for treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis lesions: a case report. ABSTRACT: Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that most frequently occurs in the lungs. However, cutaneous lesions are often the primary sign. Cutaneous sarcoidosis is difficult to treat, although different therapies have been applied. We herein report a case in which cutaneous sarcoidosis was treated with pulsed-dye laser (PDL) therapy along with oral administration of acitretin and hydroxychloroquine; no topical medications were applied. All patient details are de-identified. The treatment areas gradually improved after several courses of PDL therapy. This case illustrates that PDL therapy can serve as an auxiliary treatment for cutaneous sarcoidosis. TEXT: Introduction Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that most frequently occurs in the lungs. However, cutaneous lesions, which are present in approximately 10% to 30% of affected patients, are often the primary sign.1,2 Cutaneous sarcoidosis has various clinical manifestations, such as papules and plaques. Regardless of the clinical presentation, noncaseating granulomas are the most characteristic histologic manifestation. Cutaneous sarcoidosis remains difficult to treat, although different therapies have been applied. We herein report a case in which cutaneous sarcoidosis was improved by pulsed-dye laser (PDL) therapy. Case report In December 2018, a 46-year-old Asian woman presented for a consultation regarding left facial lesions (Figure 1(a)), which had been gradually increasing in size for more than 7 years. Symptoms such as pain and pruritus were absent. Figure 1. Clinical photographs before and after the treatment. (a) Initial findings. The main lesion was a red plaque with an approximate size of 8 \u00d7 8 cm anterior to the left ear and involving the auricle. Telangiectasia was visible in the middle of the plaque, surrounded by several papules and nodules. (b) Findings 15 months post-treatment. The plaque was thinned (which was more obvious in the marked yellow rectangular regions) after the use of oral acitretin and hydroxychloroquine and 10 pulsed-dye laser therapy sessions. These changes were more clearly visible in the central lesion, where several tiny islands of normal skin had appeared (green arrows). Telangiectasia was less obvious (yellow arrow). However, some small papules had emerged in the periphery (blue arrows). The patient had visited several hospitals. Laboratory test results were normal, and a T-SPOT.TB test was negative. Chest computed tomography showed no evidence of organ involvement. Pulmonary function tests and electrocardiograms were normal. Repeated histopathological examinations suggested a noncaseating granulomatous disease, and acid-fast staining was negative. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction analysis detected no Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in the tissues.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597028.3275077}
