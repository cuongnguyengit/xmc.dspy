ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \u201cI think I\u2019m having a stroke.\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient. We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Hypokalemic paralysis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, thiazide diuretics, alcohol abuse, anxiety, hypertension\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: The effect of dalteparin versus unfractionated heparin on the levels of troponin I and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB in elective percutaneous coronary intervention: a multicenter study. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of dalteparin during an elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure in a large cohort. METHODS In this prospective, randomized, open-label design study, 733 patients undergoing elective PCI were divided into an unfractionated heparin group (group 1, 323 patients) or a dalteparin group (group 2, 410 patients). Blood samples were collected before and 18-24 h after the PCI procedure to determine the serum levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB. Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and bleeding events during hospitalization were also recorded. Patients with an increased level of serum cTnI before PCI were excluded from the study. RESULTS After PCI, the cTnI values were greater than three times the upper limit of normal in 43 cases (13.3%) in group 1 and 52 cases (12.7%) in group 2, without a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.801). An increased creatine kinase isoenzyme MB level of greater than two times the upper limit of normal was found in 10 cases (3.1%) in group 1 and 12 cases (2.9%) in group 2, without a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.894). Postoperative bleeding was observed in nine patients (2.8%) in group 1 and six patients (1.5%) in group 2. Postoperative MACEs were observed in two patients (0.6%) in group 1 and two patients (0.5%) in group 2. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to bleeding events or MACEs. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that dalteparin might be as effective and safe as unfractionated heparin for anticoagulation during elective PCI.
