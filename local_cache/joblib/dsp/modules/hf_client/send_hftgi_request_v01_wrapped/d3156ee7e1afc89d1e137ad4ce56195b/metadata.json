ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Intravitreal aflibercept and ranibizumab for pachychoroid neovasculopathy. ABSTRACT: This retrospective study was to compare the efficacy of intravitreal injection of ranibizumab and aflibercept for patients with pachychoroid neovasculopathy. 54 eyes were initially treated with 3 monthly loading injections of ranibizumab or aflibercept. Treatment switching from ranibizumab to aflibercept, and aflibercept to photodynamic therapy was done at 3 months in case of incomplete fluid absorption. At 3 months, the rate of complete fluid absorption was significantly higher in the aflibercept-treated group than in the ranibizumab-treated group (82.6% vs 51.6%, p = 0.018). The mean reduction of subfoveal choroidal thickness was significantly greater in the aflibercept group than in the ranibizumab group (-35 \u00b5m vs -9 \u00b5m, p = 0.013). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of visual improvement or decrease in central macular thickness. Complete fluid absorption was achieved after switching from ranibizumab to aflibercept in 13 of 15 eyes (86.7%). Adjunctive photodynamic therapy was required in 6 eyes. In conclusion, treatment mainly with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor effectively improved visual acuity within 12 months (from 20/56 to 20/44 at 3 months and to 20/36 at 12 months). Aflibercept was superior to ranibizumab in achieving dry macula and reducing choroidal thickness at 3 months. TEXT: Introduction The term \u201cpachychoroid neovasculopathy\u201d has been introduced to describe Type 1 neovascularization associated with choroidal thickening and/or dilated Haller vessels in the absence of characteristic age-related macular degeneration features1,2. It is a newly recognized clinical entity of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) that is thought to be induced by pachychoroid phenotype\u2013driven pathophysiological mechanisms3. This disease entity has been suggested to be in the spectrum between central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Pang and Freund reported that pachychoroid neovasculopathy can develop after long-standing CSC and may eventually progress to PCV in some cases2.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596074.1628623}
