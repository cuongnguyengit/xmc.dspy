ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a disease of disparity most prevalent in developing countries and among immigrant populations. Mitral stenosis (MS) is a common sequalae of RHD and affects females disproportionately more than males. Rheumatic MS remains a significant management challenge as severe MS is usually poorly tolerated in pregnancy due to haemodynamic changes and increased cardiovascular demands of progressing pregnancy. Pregnancy remains contraindicated in current management guidelines based on expert consensus, due to a paucity of evidence-based literature. A 28-year-old aboriginal woman with known severe MS was found to be pregnant during routine health review, despite contraceptive efforts. Echocardiography demonstrated mean mitral valve (MV) gradient 14 mmHg; stress echocardiography demonstrated increased MV gradient 28-32 mmHg at peak exercise and post-exercise pulmonary artery pressure 56 + 3 mmHg with marked dynamic D-shaped septal flattening. Left ventricular systolic function remained preserved. She remained remarkably asymptomatic and underwent successful elective induction of labour at 34 weeks. Postpartum, she remained euvolaemic despite worsening MV gradients and new atrial fibrillation (AF). She subsequently underwent balloon mitral valvuloplasty with good result. Severe rheumatic MS in pregnancy carries significant morbidity and mortality, due to an already fragile predisposition towards heart failure development compounded by altered haemodynamics. Pregnancy avoidance and valvular intervention prior to conception or in the second trimester remain the mainstay of MS management; however, we present an encouraging case of successful near-term pregnancy with minimal complications in a medically managed asymptomatic patient with critical MS, who subsequently underwent valvular intervention post-partum. TEXT: Learning points There is limited information regarding the management of severe mitral stenosis (MS) in women of childbearing age or who are pregnant, particularly if they remain asymptomatic. Serial echocardiography combined with stress testing and physiological assessment for surveillance of mitral valve gradients, symptoms, and overall function during pregnancy may be utilized in asymptomatic patients to guide optimization of medical therapy, and timing of percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (BMV). Percutaneous BMV may be safely deferred until postpartum in women with severe MS who remain asymptomatic, to minimize procedural risks for mother and developing foetus.
