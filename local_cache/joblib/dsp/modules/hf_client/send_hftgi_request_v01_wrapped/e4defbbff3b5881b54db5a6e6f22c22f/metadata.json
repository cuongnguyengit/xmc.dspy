ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Regorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor which targets tumor angiogenesis, the tumor microenvironment and oncogenesis. Based on this mode of action, regorafenib has a broad spectrum of toxicities. However, at present, few reports have focused on autoimmune adverse events. We report a first case of regorafenib-induced exacerbation of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura in remission during treatment for the patients with heavily treated advanced colorectal cancer. This case report highlights the need for caution with regard to regorafenib treatment in patients with cancer with concomitant immune thrombocytopenic purpura. TEXT: Introduction Regorafenib is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor which targets tumor angiogenesis [vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)1-3 and TIE2], tumor microenvironment (platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1), and oncogenesis (c-KIT, RET, RAF-1 and B-RAF) (1). Based on this mode of action, regorafenib has a broad spectrum of toxicities (2). To date, however, few reports have focused on autoimmune adverse events. Case report The patient was a Japanese woman who had a past medical history of chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) which developed at the age of 38 years and was treated with steroid therapy, which resulted in remission for more than 20 years without medication. She was diagnosed with recurrent colon cancer at age 66 years, after primary surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin. She had received three lines of palliative chemotherapy including fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) plus bevacizumab, panitumumab monotherapy and trifluridine/tipiracil. Platelet-associated IgG (PAIgG) was not detected when FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab was initiated. High-grade thrombocytopenia was not observed during treatment for recurrent colon cancer.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597090.4925704}
