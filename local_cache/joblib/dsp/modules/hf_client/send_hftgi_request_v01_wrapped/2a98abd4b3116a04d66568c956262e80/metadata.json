ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Candida infections of the central nervous system (CNS) are rare. We report a case of Candida glabrata meningitis successfully treated with combination antifungal therapy followed by step-down therapy with fluconazole. New-onset hypercalcaemia, an uncommon side effect of the prolonged fluconazole treatment, prompted early treatment cessation. A negative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \u03b2-d-glucan supported the decision of treatment cessation despite incomplete resolution of CSF biochemical parameters. No disease relapse was encountered after 2 years post-treatment. TEXT: 1 Introduction Candida infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is an uncommon manifestation of invasive candidiasis, with Candida albicans being the most commonly identified species [1,2]. The populations most at risk are low birth weight neonates, patients with CNS ventriculostomies, or immunocompromised hosts [3,4]. Due to the rarity of these infections, no randomised controlled trials exist to evaluate the appropriate choice and duration of antifungal treatment. Current guidance recommends antifungal treatment until resolution of all radiological abnormalities and biochemical parameters in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as microbiological relapse is not uncommon [4]. While various biochemical parameters, including CSF \u03b2-d-glucan, have been utilised as a marker of fungal disease, the role of such biomarkers in guiding treatment is still unclear [3,5]. We present a case of Candida glabrata meningitis successfully treated with fluconazole therapy, in which negative CSF \u03b2-d-glucan was used as a marker for treatment cessation despite persistence of other CSF biochemical abnormalities. The patient was followed up for more than 2 years post-treatment without clinical evidence of relapse. 2 Case presentation\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597158.5186243}
