ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND In this case report, we describe a very rare case of severe limb ischemia due to an arterial embolus caused by an aneurysm of the oval foramen in a term-born infant that occurred in the first few hours after birth. METHODS A newborn male Caucasian patient presented on the maternity ward with ischemia of the right foot. Ischemia was treated with nitroglycerin spray and low-molecular-weight heparin in therapeutic dosage. An aneurysm of the oval foramen was found during postnatal echocardiography screening. This was thought to be the source of an embolus causing limb ischemia. At birth and upon follow-up, no clotting disorders were found. A large part of the right forefoot was ischemic, leading to loss of digits 1, 2, and 3. No significant loss of function was found in the first year of life. CONCLUSIONS Severe limb ischemia can be caused by an embolus arising from an aneurysm of the oval foramen and can be treated with heparin. TEXT: pmcBackground Spontaneous acute limb ischemia is a rare problem in neonates, occurring in 2.4 out of every 1000 patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) [1]. It can have severe consequences and result in loss of limb. The vast majority of cases (88%) of acute limb injury in neonates are secondary to iatrogenic injury due to arterial cannulation and subsequent thrombosis [2\u20134]. Clotting disorders or vascular malformations can also be identified as causes, but there are only a few case reports of spontaneous ischemia without apparent cause [5]. We describe a case of an arterial embolus leading to ischemia of a limb that was most likely due to a thrombus originating from an aneurysm of the oval foramen.
