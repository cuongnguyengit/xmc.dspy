ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \"found down\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \u201ccatch up\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient. We will first extract the text from the article, then we will look for the drug names mentioned in the text, and finally we will check for any adverse reactions associated with those drugs.\\nReactions: compartment syndrome, crush syndrome, sleep disruption, fatigue, poor performance, patient harm, sleep deprivation, vigilance, cognition, memory, fine motor skills, cognitive performance decline, alcohol intoxication, blood alcohol concentration, pressure increase, closed fascial space, reduced capillary perfusion, long bone fracture, muscle necrosis, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, death\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Fanconi-Bickel syndrome in an infant with cytomegalovirus infection: A case report and review of the literature. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation of the SLC2A2 gene, which encodes glucose transporter protein 2 (GLUT2). METHODS We report a 7-mo-old girl with cytomegalovirus infection presenting hepatomegaly, jaundice, liver transaminase elevation, fasting hypoglycemia, hyperglycosuria, proteinuria, hypophosphatemia, rickets, and growth retardation. After prescription of ganciclovir, the levels of bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase decreased to normal, while she still had aggravating hepatomegaly and severe hyperglycosuria. Then, whole exome sequencing was conducted and revealed a homozygous c.416delC mutation in exon 4 of SLC2A2 inherited from her parents, which was predicted to change alanine 139 to valine (p.A139Vfs*3), indicating a diagnosis of FBS. During the follow-up, the entire laboratory test returned to normal with extra supplement of vitamin D and corn starch. Her weight increased to normal range at 3 years old without hepatomegaly. However, she still had short stature. Although there was heterogeneity between phenotype and genotype, Chinese children had typical clinical manifestations. No hot spot mutation or association between severity and mutations was found, but nonsense and missense mutations were more common. Data of long-term follow-up were rare, leading to insufficient assessment of the prognosis in Chinese children. CONCLUSIONS FBS is a rare genetic metabolic disease causing impaired glucose liver homeostasis and proximal renal tubular dysfunction. Results of urine and blood testing suggesting abnormal glucose metabolism could be the clues for FBS in neonates and infants. Genetic sequencing is indispensable for diagnosis. Since the diversity of disease severity, early identification and long-term follow-up could help improve patients\\' quality of life and decrease mortality.
