ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy. Nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, markedly improved overall survival in advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, ICIs can rarely trigger massive inflammation, a phenomenon characterized by rapid acceleration in radiographic tumor growth, the mechanisms underlying which are largely unknown. We report three patients with metastatic RCC who experienced rapid radiographic progression and clinical deterioration following treatment with nivolumab. However, histological analysis revealed no viable cancer despite the evidence of radiological progression. Instead, extensive necrosis and lymphohistiocytic infiltration were noted, as described previously in patients with ICI-induced pseudoprogression. Based on these observations, we postulate that exuberant antitumor inflammatory responses may contribute to adverse clinical outcomes in some patients with ICI-induced radiographic progression. Prospective studies incorporating tumor biopsies may shed more light on this rare phenomenon. TEXT: Background Monoclonal antibodies against programmed cell death protein-1(PD-1) and other co-inhibitory immune checkpoints act by reinvigorating antitumor effector T-cell responses (1). Nivolumab, a fully human Ig4 anti-PD-1 antibody, was demonstrated to significantly improve overall survival compared to everolimus among patients with previously treated clear cell RCC (RCC) in CheckMate-025, a phase 3 randomized open-label trial (2). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) can occasionally lead to atypical responses such as pseudoprogression and hyperprogression. Pseudoprogression is defined as a transient radiological worsening followed by shrinkage of tumors with continued therapy (3). This phenomenon partly explains the benefit from treatment beyond radiological progression in patients who do not experience overt clinical deterioration (4, 5). A small minority of patients experience a more dramatic acceleration in tumor growth along with rapid clinical deterioration when exposed to ICIs, a phenomenon termed hyperprogression (3, 6). The mechanisms underlying ICI-related hyperprogressive disease remain poorly defined. We describe three patients with metastatic RCC who experienced rapid radiographic progression on nivolumab and analyze their tumor histologies. This study was approved by our Institutional Review Board (BDR No. 120019) and Informed consent was obtained from the next of kin.
