ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Clinical Characteristics, Histopathology, and Treatment Outcomes of Pythium Keratitis: A Retrospective Cohort Study. ABSTRACT: To identify factors associated with the prognosis in Pythium keratitis. The medical records of 25 patients (26 eyes) diagnosed with Pythium keratitis at a referral institution were reviewed. The demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment, microbiological diagnosis, histopathological features, and outcomes were recorded. The histopathological specimens were reviewed. The patients were divided into a globe removal group and a globe salvage group. Univariate analysis was used to identify factors associated with poor outcomes. Fifteen eyes (57.7%) were removed. Patients in the globe removal group were on average 16.4 years older (95% CI 6.98 to 25.88) than those in the globe salvage group, received the first medication (either topical antifungals or antibiotics) later than one day after the onset of symptoms (RR = 2.75, 95% CI 1.18 to 6.42), and had a maximal diameter of the infiltration area \u22656 mm (RR = 3.14, 95% CI 1.17 to 8.45). The globe removal group showed satellite, multifocal, or total corneal infiltration patterns (RR = 2.82, 95% CI 1.03 to 7.74) and a hypopyon (RR = 3.43, 95% CI 1.26 to 9.35) as risk factors. The histopathological examination showed a higher density of Pythium in the globe removal group than the globe salvage group (median 376 (interquartile range 323, 620) versus 107 (interquartile range 16, 260) hyphae per high power field; P = 0.035). The risk of globe removal in patients with Pythium keratitis increased with age, delayed initial topical antifungal or antibiotic treatment, advanced disease at presentation, and dense Pythium hyphae infiltration of the cornea. Early recognition and treatment are critical to successfully eradicate the infection. TEXT: Introduction Pythium keratitis is a sight-threatening ocular disease caused by Pythium insidiosum, an aquatic oomycete. Incidence of Pythium keratitis were primarily reported in the tropical, subtropical area especially Thailand and India.1\u20134 Direct exposure of the cornea to the zoospores, the infectious form of P.insidiosum, can result in the development of the disease.5 According to previous reports, a history of exposure to contaminated water or vegetative material was an important risk factor for acquiring the infection.1,2,6\u20138 Various patterns of infiltration are described in Pythium keratitis, for example, multiple tentacle-like infiltrations, dot-like lesions, and reticular infiltrations.1,2,6,7,9\u201313\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597192.3169372}
