ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Exogenous insulin antibody syndrome (EIAS), which rarely occurs in the patient with type 1 diabetes, results in antibody-induced insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, ketosis, ketoacidosis, and hypoglycemia when insulin is released from the saturated insulin antibodies. Recommended treatment regimens include glucocorticoids, immunosuppressants, and plasmapheresis. In the patient with type 1 diabetes, glucocorticoids may by inducing and/or worsening ketoacidosis be contraindicated. With immunosuppressants, various anecdotal treatment regimens have been reported. Currently the most commonly recommended regimen is intravenous immunosuppressive therapy in combination with oral immunosuppressants. Herein we describe a patient in whom oral immunosuppressant monotherapy with mycophenolate resulted in the cure of EIAS, thus avoiding the expense associated with intravenous immunosuppressant therapy and/or hospitalization for plasmapheresis. TEXT: pmcKey Summary Points Insulin antibody syndrome results in insulin resistance, hyperglycemia and later hypoglycemia. Therapies for insulin antibody syndrome are anecdotal and include plasmapheresis, immunosuppression and glucocorticoids. The most common current recommendation is combined intravenous and oral immunosuppressants. In this case we show the efficacy of the more convenient and economic oral immunosuppressant monotherapy. Introduction Insulin resistance is defined as the need to use 200 or more units of insulin a day or more than 2 units of insulin per kilogram of body weight. Insulin resistance caused by the generation of insulin antibodies has been name exogenous insulin antibody syndrome (EIAS) [1]. First isolated in 1956, insulin antibodies were shown to be present in 98% of patients who utilized insulin when only insulins derived from animal sources were available [2]. Since that time, with the use of more purified insulins the incidence has dropped significantly but EIAS still occurs with the use of both human and analogue insulins [3, 4]. Some analogues have shown decreased antibody formation but there is no consistent recommendation for changes in insulin formulation to decrease insulin antibodies [5, 6]. Severe insulin resistance due to exogenous insulin antibodies is extremely rare and is estimated to occur in less than 0.17% of patients with diabetes. Insulin antibody levels have not been shown to correlate with glycemic control. However, the EIAS causes extreme insulin resistance leading to post-prandial hyperglycemic and ketosis and severe hypoglycemia due to release of insulin from the insulin antibody complex. The majority of case reports are in patients with type 2 diabetes, and EIAS is very uncommon in type 1 diabetes where it has been associated with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597125.4700274}
