ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: For patients with Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) who experience relapse post allogeneic stem cell transplantation, limited treatment options exist, and the ultimate outcome is poor. Recently, the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors have shown remarkable efficacy in patients with refractory/relapsed HL, also demonstrating an acceptable safety profile. However, due to effects on T-cell activity, the use of PD-1 inhibitors post allografting may potentially increase the risk of treatment-emergent graft versus host disease. We herein report the clinical course of a patient who experienced multiple relapses of HL post allogeneic stem cell transplantation. He failed several treatment modalities but he responded to escalating doses of the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab, given at two different treatment time points, also demonstrating minimal and easily manageable toxicity. TEXT: Introduction In patients allografted for refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) who experience disease recurrence post allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), the traditional immunomodulatory approaches [reduction or discontinuation of immunosuppressive treatment (IST) with or without donor\u2019s lymphocytes infusions (DLIs)] are only partially effective and are usually accompanied with high incidence of induced graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), while chemotherapeutic approaches are mostly unsuccessful.1,2 It has been shown that HL cells have a unique biologic dependence on the programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), which is expressed on activated T-cells, and other lymphoid and myeloid cells.3,4 Nivolumab (Opdivo\u00ae, Bristol-Meyers Squibb), a fully humanized IgG4 anti\u2013PD-1 monoclonal antibody, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of adults with relapsed/refractory classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) after autoHSCT and Brentuximab Vendotin (BV) treatment.5,6 For patients who have relapsed HL post allograft, the inhibition of the PD-1 pathway, might theoretically enhance the graft versus HL (GvHL) effect by upregulating the activation of donor-derived T-cells however, the increased alloreactivity of donor Tcells may also promote severe treatmentemergent GvHD (te-GvHD), thus contributing to increased risk for morbidity and mortality. 7 Herein, we describe the clinical course of a patient with HL, who experienced early relapse post alloSCT and failed to achieve disease control after immunomodulatory approaches (including anti-CD30 infusion), but responded twice to Nivolumab treatment. To reduce the risk of GvHD without negatively affecting the GvHL effect, we treated the patient with escalating doses of Nivolumab.
