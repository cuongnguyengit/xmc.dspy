ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: COVID-19 is generally a benign or asymptomatic infection in children, but can occasionally be severe or fatal. Delayed presentation of COVID-19 with hyperinflammation and multi-organ involvement was recently recognized, designated the Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). Six children with MIS-C with molecular and serologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection were admitted to our hospital between May 5, 2020 and June 25, 2020. All had fever and weakness; 4/6 presented with gastrointestinal symptoms. Two children had features of complete Kawasaki disease, 3 had incomplete Kawasaki disease, while 1 had terminal ileitis with delayed onset of circulatory shock. Treatment consisted of intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin for Kawasaki-like disease. Remdesivir, corticosteroids, and infliximab were used when indicated. Median hospitalization was 7 days. Immediate treatment resulted in rapid clinical improvement. In children presenting with hyperinflammatory syndromes without cardiac manifestations, testing for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies, with close cardiac monitoring should be pursued due to the manifold presentations of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. TEXT: Introduction SARS-CoV-2 was identified in December 2019 as causing a cluster of pneumonia in Wuhan City, China, although the first affected individual (\u201cpatient zero\u201d) may have been an adult in Hubei province on November 17, 2019.1 The disease, termed COVID-19, was declared a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.1 SARS-CoV-2 infections in adults can range from the asymptomatic to the fatal, with the most feared illnesses being severe interstitial pneumonia and hyperactivation of the inflammatory cascade.2,3 By way of contrast, an early systematic literature review of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection indicated that children typically had asymptomatic infection or mild respiratory symptoms such as dry cough, fever, and fatigue.4 More recently, there emerged reports of children in Europe presenting with a severe hyperinflammatory syndrome and multi-organ involvement with some deaths temporally related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to widespread concerns among physicians and parents alike.5,6 This has since been identified in the United States, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue a warning and provide a case definition and guidance on diagnosis and management on what is now termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States and Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS) in Europe.5-7 Within a span of 7 weeks, we encountered 6 children with MIS-C with myriad clinical presentations, all clearly linked to SARS-CoV-2 infections. The first 5 were hospitalized within the first 2.5 weeks of this time interval and the sixth a month later, mirroring the leve\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597111.9029567}
