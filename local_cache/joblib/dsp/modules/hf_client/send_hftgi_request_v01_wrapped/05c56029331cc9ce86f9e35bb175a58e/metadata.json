ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: The survival outcomes of the FLAURA trial support osimertinib as the new standard of care for untreated patients harboring activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Despite the initial response, disease progression invariably occurs. Although uncommon, BRAF V600E mutation arises as a unique mechanism of resistance, and thus far, no prospective studies are available to support concurrent EGFR/BRAF blockade. We report a case of impressive radiological and ctDNA response under dabrafenib, trametinib, and osimertinib in an advanced EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patient who developed BRAF V600E as one of the acquired resistance mechanisms to second-line osimertinib. Moreover, the patient experienced remarkable clinical improvement and good tolerance to combination therapy. The present case suggests the importance of prospective studies evaluating both efficacy and safety of the combination in later line settings and points towards the potential of ctDNA to monitor resistance mechanisms and treatment benefit in clinical practice. TEXT: Introduction The use of osimertinib to target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has become the standard of care in untreated EGFR-mutant non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Although osimertinib can be highly active, showing more durable outcomes than first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)1, most tumors invariably become resistant, limiting its long-term clinical benefit. The heterogeneity of resistance mechanisms to osimertinib, including EGFR C797S mutation, EGFR, and MET amplifications, off-target mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS, and HER2 as well as histologic transformation2\u20139, has stimulated routine performance of repeated biopsies to identify specific underlying mechanisms of resistance throughout the treatment course, and to guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome and prevent acquired resistance (AR)7,10\u201313. Combined targeted therapy (TT) strategies have been increasingly addressed in prospective clinical trials14\u201317. A phase Ib/II trial reported 47% ORR with a combination of capmatinib (MET inhibitor) plus gefitinib in patients progressing to EGFR TKI and presenting MET dysregulation14. Likewise, SAVANNAH (NCT03778229)15 is an ongoing phase II trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of combination savolitinib and osimertinib in post-osimertinib progression/MET-positive patients. The biomarker-matched study ORCHARD (NCT03944772)16 is also underway to assess the efficacy of several osimertinib-based combinations following disease progression under frontline osimertinib.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597172.3820677}
