ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND There is a lack of information about a mixed type of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) after heart transplantation (HTx) with no amiodarone treatment in almost 1 year. Frequent ventricular extrasystoles (VES) associated with a mixed type of AIT can often be treated using thiamazole and prednisolone, without the need for specific antiarrhythmic treatment. METHODS We present a clinical case of a 65-year-old heart transplanted male patient with frequent VES associated with mixed type of AIT. Recipient had managed with amiodarone prior to HTx but there were no indications for it after the surgery. One year after antiarrhythmic treatment was discontinued, monomorphic VES (total amount: 27 472/day) were diagnosed. In addition, our investigation revealed that thyrotoxicosis developed. Prednisolone and thiamazole were added to the treatment with positive outcomes. The antithyroid treatment had been discontinued after 9 months and results of the 24-h Holter electrocardiogram monitoring showed only two VES/24 h. CONCLUSIONS The case highlights the association of amiodarone, thyroid disorders, and VES. In mixed type AIT or if diagnosis is uncertain, it is reasonable to use mixed therapy. Next is to decide whether you need special treatment for VES. There was no evidence of ventricular tachycardia. Thyroid function tests remained normal off antithyroid medications and the total amount of VES significantly decreased. There were no indications for any antiarrhythmic treatment or ablation. TEXT: Learning points In patients who have been treated with amiodarone prior to heart transplantation, should be periodically screened for thyroid disorders to promptly diagnosed delayed onset amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction. It is important to consider the mixed type of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis in borderline cases. Introduction Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction develops in 15\u201320% of patients under amiodarone therapy.1 Two main forms of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) may occur: Type 1 is a form of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism occurring in patients with underlying thyroid abnormalities, and Type 2 is a destructive thyroiditis mainly due to direct cytotoxic effects of amiodarone on thyroid follicular cells of a normal thyroid gland.2 At the same time, AIT Type 2 generally develops in patients without clinical, biochemical, and morphological evidence of thyroid disease.3 One study showed that despite discontinuation of amiodarone treatment at the time of the heart transplantation (HTx) procedure, patients remain at risk for developing mixed thyroid disease. Heart transplanted recipients treated with amiodarone before HTx should, therefore, be monitored carefully for a development of thyroid dysfunction, especially within the first post-transplant year.4 Timeline\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596077.772848}
