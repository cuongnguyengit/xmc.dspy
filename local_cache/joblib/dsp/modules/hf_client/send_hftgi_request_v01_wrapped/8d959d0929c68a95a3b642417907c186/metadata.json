ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: An 82-year-old woman with primary biliary cholangitis was diagnosed with an irreversible neurological disorder, caused by metronidazole (MNZ)-induced encephalopathy. Although the disorder is a reversible pathological condition, in rare cases, it can cause serious sequelae or could even be fatal. Therefore, medications should be administered carefully, particularly in patients who require long-term administration of large doses or those with liver dysfunction. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION Metronidazole (MNZ) is used as a first\u2010line treatment for Clostridium difficile (CD) colitis. MNZ\u2010induced encephalopathy is a relatively rare disease, characterized by a reversible central nervous system disorder. Generally, it is thought that the illness improves upon discontinuing medication. However, a few cases of serious residual sequelae and death have been reported, albeit in small numbers. Similarly, we have found serious residual sequelae caused by MNZ\u2010induced encephalopathy, as reported in this study. 2 CASE PRESENTATION An 82\u2010year\u2010old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of fevers and nausea for one month. Upon experiencing these symptoms, she consulted her previous doctor, which led to her being diagnosed with pyelonephritis. Levofloxacin was prescribed, and her symptoms improved. However, 14 days prior to hospitalization, she once again started suffering from fevers, as well as passing mushy stool. The previous doctor prescribed MNZ based on a diagnosis of CD enteritis, confirmed by a positive CD toxin test. Consequently, the fever declined; however, the persistent nausea and vomiting led to the hospitalization of the patient. She has a past medical history of primary biliary cholangitis, atrial fibrillation, and interstitial pneumonia. She was taking branched\u2010chain amino acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, kanamycin, spironolactone, lactulose, and apixaban. On physical examination, vital signs were as follows: JCS (Japan coma scale), 0; GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale), 4/5/6; blood pressure, 130/64 mmHg; pulse rate, 68 beats/minute and regular; body temperature, 36.8\u00b0C; peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), 95% (O2 at 2 L/min); no neurological abnormality. Laboratory examinations revealed the following: Blood test: blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 23 mg/dL. Urinalysis: white blood cells 2+, nitrate +, protein 2+. There were no other significant findings.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596067.1945913}
