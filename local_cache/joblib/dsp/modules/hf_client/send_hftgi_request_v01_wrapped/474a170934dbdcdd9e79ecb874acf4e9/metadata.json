ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Right-sided empyema secondary to esophageal rupture are rare but reported in the medical literature. We describe an atypical CASE of right-sided empyema with Candida Tropicalis, Candida Glabrata, and Staphylococcus lugdenensis leading to a diagnosis of spontaneous esophageal rupture. We concluded that pleural effusion with fungal and multi-organism growth should immediately raise suspicion for underlying missed esophageal perforation. Prompt diagnosis of esophageal perforation can prevent fatal complications like pleuritis, pneumothorax, hydrothorax, pneumomediastinum, mediastinitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and septic shock. TEXT: 1 Introduction Spontaneous esophageal rupture has an established anatomical predilection for the left-sided esophageal wall (>90%) and is often associated with left-sided thoracic cavity involvement, including pleural effusion, hydropneumothorax, and empyema. We present a CASE of right-sided hydropneumothorax growing Candida Tropicalis, Candida Glabrata, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia stemming from underlying silent esophageal rupture. 2 CASE report A 64-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension, arthritis, seizure disorder, Parkinson's disease, hiatal hernia, and chronic anemia was brought to the emergency department by his wife for acutely progressive lethargy. The patient had been experiencing non-bloody and non-bilious vomiting for the past three months with decreased oral intake. Since last month, he also developed progressive generalized weakness and new-onset dyspnea, which worsened to the point of not getting out of bed the day before the presentation. The patient was a nonsmoker and had no prior history of alcohol or any illicit drug abuse; however, he was recently reported taking excessive NSAIDs for joint pains. He was being followed by the hematology and gastroenterology team for chronic anemia. Endoscopy and colonoscopy performed three years ago (2017) had revealed gastritis, severe diverticulosis, 1 cm tubular adenoma of the splenic flexure, and hemorrhoids.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597164.2210479}
