ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Tuberculosis is a major public health problem worldwide. Tuberculosis can be confused with other diseases and its diagnosis is frequently delayed, especially in areas of low prevalence. Abdominal tuberculosis includes involvement of the gastrointestinal tract, peritoneum, lymph nodes, and/or solid organs; and accounts for 5% of all cases of tuberculosis. We report two cases of young patients who presented preoperatively as acute abdomen due to acute appendicitis. During surgery, these cases were misdiagnosed as \"carcinomatosis\", and in the postoperative period these cases were complicated with septic shock. In both cases, histopathology showed caseating granulomas which suggested tuberculous peritonitis and enteritis. Subsequently, RT-PCR in peritoneal fluid confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In one case the clinical response to treatment was excellent, and the other case was fatal. The aim of this report is to bring attention to the spectrum of tuberculosis, and to serve as a reminder of tuberculosis as the great imitator that can masquerade as cancer. Most tuberculous patients erroneously diagnosed as cancer have extensive \"neoplastic\" lesions that would suggest an advanced-stage malignancy. Assuming a case as an advanced cancer would reduce the chance of performing more exhaustive studies to get a definitive diagnosis and clinicians would be tempted to offer only palliative treatments. TEXT: Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is the most widespread infectious disease and one of the leading causes of death worldwide. 1- 3 The proportion of patients with extra-pulmonary tuberculosis has risen during the last decades all over the world. 1, 2 Tuberculosis in Peru ranks fifteenth among the causes of death, and predominantly affects the poorest social strata. 2 Abdominal tuberculosis is defined as infection of the peritoneum, omentum, mesentery, lymphatics nodes, and hollow or solid abdominal organs such as the liver, spleen, and pancreas with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. 4- 7 Abdominal TB accounts for about 5% of all TB cases and 15% of extrapulmonary TB forms and is an increasingly common disease that can have bizarre presentations. 8- 11 Case reports Herein, we present two cases of abdominal TB mimicking at the presentation an acute abdomen related to surgical aspect of appendicitis, \u201ccarcinomatosis\u201d, and septic shock. This report aims to suggest to clinicians the need of including TB in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary and extra-pulmonary malignancies.
