ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease often associated with poor prognosis. We previously showed that the localization of KIT-D816V at endolysosomes is critical to activate aberrant Akt signaling and Chlorpromazine (CPZ) perturbs the intracellular localization, leading to cell death in AML cells with KIT-D816V. We report that daily administration of CPZ, prescribed for controlling anxiety disorder in patient with AML harboring KIT-D816V, led to a dramatic reduction in AML cells. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that CPZ inhibited the growth and survival of the patient-derived AML cells, implying potent efficacy of CPZ in AML with KIT-D816V. TEXT: 1 Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease, and several genes are recurrently mutated in AML, which constitute the base for the new genomic classifications, predictive biomarkers, and new therapeutic targets. Despite the enormous progress achieved in the understandings of the disease, the standard therapy of AML has remained virtually unchanged for the past several decades. KIT is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTKs) which is expressed on the surface of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. A point mutation in the KIT gene at amino acid 816 (KIT-D816V) is an activating mutation that is found in about 30% of patients in core-binding factor (CBF)\u2013AML [1]. In addition, the same mutation is typical of systemic mastocytosis, a rare disorder characterized by overproduction of mast cells that accumulate in the skin and organs. Although AML-M2 (according to the FAB classification) accompanied by the chromosomal translocation t(8;21)(q22;q22), in the following denoted as RUNX1-RUNX1T1, is classified into a good prognostic group, KIT exon 17 mutation is a poor prognostic factor in AML patients with RUNX1-RUNX1T12. Wild-type (WT)-KIT plays an important role in the proliferation and maintenance of normal cells. Upon ligand binding, WT-KIT is internalized and transferred to early endosomes and after delivering proper signals to downstream molecules, a fraction of WT-KIT is transferred via late endosomes for its degradation in lysosomes. Notably, the intracellular trafficking of KIT-D816V is different and it may persist in intracellular compartments [3], leading to the sustained and aberrant oncogenic KIT signaling in endolysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum, which result in the uncontrolled proliferation of malignant cells [4]. We recently showed that Chlorpromazine (CPZ), which is a widely used as an antipsychotic drug, interferes with the intracellular localization of KIT-D816V, leading to cell death in AML cells with KIT-D816V in vitro and in vivo[5]. We herein report that daily administration of CPZ, prescribed for controlling anxiety disorder in an AML patient with RUNX1-RUNX1T1 harboring KIT-D816V, led to a dramatic reduction in AML cells. 2 Materials & methods\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597137.1122427}
