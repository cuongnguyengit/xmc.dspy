ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: An 82-year-old woman with primary biliary cholangitis was diagnosed with an irreversible neurological disorder, caused by metronidazole (MNZ)-induced encephalopathy. Although the disorder is a reversible pathological condition, in rare cases, it can cause serious sequelae or could even be fatal. Therefore, medications should be administered carefully, particularly in patients who require long-term administration of large doses or those with liver dysfunction. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION Metronidazole (MNZ) is used as a first\u2010line treatment for Clostridium difficile (CD) colitis. MNZ\u2010induced encephalopathy is a relatively rare disease, characterized by a reversible central nervous system disorder. Generally, it is thought that the illness improves upon discontinuing medication. However, a few cases of serious residual sequelae and death have been reported, albeit in small numbers. Similarly, we have found serious residual sequelae caused by MNZ\u2010induced encephalopathy, as reported in this study. 2 CASE PRESENTATION An 82\u2010year\u2010old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of fevers and nausea for one month. Upon experiencing these symptoms, she consulted her previous doctor, which led to her being diagnosed with pyelonephritis. Levofloxacin was prescribed, and her symptoms improved. However, 14 days prior to hospitalization, she once again started suffering from fevers, as well as passing mushy stool. The previous doctor prescribed MNZ based on a diagnosis of CD enteritis, confirmed by a positive CD toxin test. Consequently, the fever declined; however, the persistent nausea and vomiting led to the hospitalization of the patient. She has a past medical history of primary biliary cholangitis, atrial fibrillation, and interstitial pneumonia. She was taking branched\u2010chain amino acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, kanamycin, spironolactone, lactulose, and apixaban. On physical examination, vital signs were as follows: JCS (Japan coma scale), 0; GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale), 4/5/6; blood pressure, 130/64 mmHg; pulse rate, 68 beats/minute and regular; body temperature, 36.8\u00b0C; peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), 95% (O2 at 2 L/min); no neurological abnormality. Laboratory examinations revealed the following: Blood test: blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 23 mg/dL. Urinalysis: white blood cells 2+, nitrate +, protein 2+. There were no other significant findings.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596105.3819697}
