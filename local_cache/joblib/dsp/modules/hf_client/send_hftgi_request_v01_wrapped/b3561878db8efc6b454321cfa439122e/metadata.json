ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: A 39-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital on 19 January 2019 because of a 10-day history of intolerance to oils in her food, fatigue, and yellowing of the skin and sclera. In December 2018, the patient had been diagnosed with tuberculous pleurisy at a local hospital and received quadruple anti-tuberculosis treatment. Ten days before presentation to our hospital, she had developed anorexia, fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, cough, and shortness of breath. She visited a local hospital, where she was considered to have drug-induced hepatitis. She discontinued the anti-tuberculosis drugs and liver protection treatment. After 3 days, her symptoms had not substantially improved. She visited the infection department of our hospital for further diagnosis and treatment. After 6 days of treatment, the patient's symptoms were not significantly improved, her liver and muscle enzyme concentrations were further increased, and her limbs had become weaker and more difficult to move. We considered diagnoses of drug-induced hepatitis and drug-induced myopathy. The patient was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone at 40 mg once a day for 16 days and other symptomatic treatments. Her symptoms significantly improved and she was discharged. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Drug-induced liver injury is one of the most common and serious adverse drug reactions1,2 and can cause acute liver failure or even death.3 The clinical manifestations of drug-induced myopathy vary; mild cases only cause symptoms such as muscle pain and joint pain, whereas severe cases can lead to rhabdomyolysis and even myoglobinuric acute renal failure, which is life-threatening.4,5 In clinical practice, the diagnosis and treatment of drug-induced myopathy are unclear. This study was performed to summarize the clinical characteristics of drug-induced myopathy and provide a treatment reference by reviewing one successfully treated case in our department. The reporting of this case conforms to the CARE guidelines.6 The patient provided written informed consent for treatment and publication. The requirement for ethics approval was waived because of the nature of this study (case report).
