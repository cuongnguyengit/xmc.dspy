ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: We report an acute clinical course of pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila in a patient receiving chemotherapy for lung cancer and corticosteroid therapy. A 57-year-old man presented with fever and dyspnoea and was admitted to our hospital. Chest computed tomography revealed a new left lower lung infiltrate, tumour progression in the right upper lung region, metastases to lymph nodes and pleural effusion. The urinary antigen test for Legionella was positive. The patient's oxygen requirement increased on the day of admission, and he died the day after hospitalization. Legionnaires' disease may manifest with an acute presentation, and patients in Japan with physical risk factors for this disease could get infected despite the absence of environmental risk factors. Early treatment for suspected Legionnaire's disease should be considered. TEXT: pmcINTRODUCTION Legionnaires' disease was first identified in 1976 during the investigation of a major pneumonia outbreak in Philadelphia. It is mainly transmitted via infectious aerosols. 1 Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease range from mild to severe, with a reported mortality rate of approximately 6%. 2 Limited evidence exists regarding the interval between the onset of Legionnaires' disease symptoms and hospital admission. We report a case wherein Legionella pneumophila pneumonia developed rapidly and without obvious environmental risk factors in a lung cancer patient in Japan.
