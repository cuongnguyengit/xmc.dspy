ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Myelofibrosis (MF) is often associated with chronic myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome and primary myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), but few number cases of malignant lymphoma with myelofibrosis was reported, and a few cases about follicular lymphoma with MF were found. Here we described a case of follicular lymphoma (FL) complicated by myelofibrosis. A 43-year-old man was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma (FL) complicated by MF, besides, the lymphoma staging of this patient was AnnArbor IV B. The cytokines of plated-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) were positive, while JAK2V617F, MPL, and CALR mutations were negative. After first course of chemotherapy, the peripheral blood and MF improved. The systemic superficial lymph nodes and spleen were significantly narrowed after the third cycle of chemotherapy. The production of various cytokines, such as b-FGF, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2, PDGF, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, may contribute to the development of MF. TEXT: Introduction We described a case report of simultaneous follicular lymphoma with myelofibrosis, which leads to a serious of problem in diagnosis, etiology and treatment, and promotes us to critically review the literature. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the second most common lymphoma in western countries, accounting for about 35% of all of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL).1,2 In China, follicular lymphoma accounts for a slightly lower proportion of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, but it is still a common type.3 Follicular lymphoma is an indolent B-cell lymphoma typically presenting with diffuse lymphadenopathy, bone marrow involvement, and splenomegaly. Extranodal involvement is less common.2 The majority of FL patients have the characteristic of t(14;18) (q32;q21) translocation, which results in the overexpression of the BCL-2 protein.4 In most cases, immunohistochemical staining is positive for CD19, CD20, CD10, monoclonal immunoglobulin and bcl-2 protein.2 Myelofibrosis (MF) is characterized by the increase in BM stromal fibers composed of reticulin and collagen.5 A wide variety of hematological malignancies result in myelofibrosis, including chronic myeloid leukemia, acute megaloblastic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. But MF complicated with malignant lymphoma is rare,6 and we found a few case reports of FL with myelofibrosis.7,8 Case Presentation\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597185.64824}
