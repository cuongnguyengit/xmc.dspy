ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: We herein report a 46-year-old man who suffered an intentional acetaminophen overdose. Laboratory results revealed leukocytosis and an elevated procalcitonin level (8.48 ng/mL). Computed tomography showed findings suggesting possible colitis. Due to concerns about sepsis in addition to acetaminophen overdose, oral N-acetyl cysteine and piperacillin/tazobactam were started. His procalcitonin levels further increased; however, the patient remained afebrile, and the C-reactive protein levels were normal. Piperacillin/tazobactam was discontinued, and he remained stable without antibiotics. The present case shows that the toxicokinetics of acetaminophen overdose can cause an elevated procalcitonin level. Furthermore, procalcitonin levels alone should not guide the need for antibiotics in such cases. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Acetaminophen is an analgesic and antipyretic commonly used by millions of people, with over 600 marketed products, including over-the-counter (OTC) drugs. Given its popularity, acetaminophen overdose is the most common cause of drug-induced acute liver injury in the United States (1), and intentional acetaminophen overdose is often cited as a common suicidal activity (2). Patients with acetaminophen overdose often have non-specific symptoms, such as generalized weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea. While acetaminophen-induced liver injury is considered to occur in a dose-dependent fashion, those who overdose with relatively low-dose acetaminophen over several days may still suffer liver toxicity. The serum aminotransferase levels on admission are frequently within normal limits but may rapidly increase within 24 hours after hospitalization (3). The standard treatment for acetaminophen overdose is N-acetyl cysteine administration, which effectively mitigates liver injury if administered early (4). Procalcitonin (PCT), an active precursor of calcitonin, is associated with the response to bacterial infection (5). Despite its usefulness for guiding antibiotic therapy in cases of severe infection, such as sepsis (6-8), dependence on PCT to diagnose sepsis has been the subject of debate over the past several years (9,10). We herein report a case of intentional acetaminophen overdose in a patient with a significantly elevated PCT level. While the patient received antibiotics initially, the medical team ruled out sepsis following an observation period. The elevated PCT level was considered to be acetaminophen-induced. This case shows that acetaminophen overdose can significantly increase PCT levels and mimic sepsis, resulting in unnecessary antibiotic use.
