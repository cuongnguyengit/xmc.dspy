ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Background Precision medicine and drug repurposing are attractive strategies, especially for tumors with worse prognosis. Glioblastoma is a highly malignant brain tumor with limited treatment options and short survival times. We identified novel BRAF (47-438del) and PIK3R1 (G376R) mutations in a glioblastoma patient by RNA-sequencing. Methods The protein expression of BRAF and PIK3R1 as well as the lack of EGFR expression as analyzed by immunohistochemistry corroborated RNA-sequencing data. The expression of additional markers (AKT, SRC, mTOR, NF-\u03baB, Ki-67) emphasized the aggressiveness of the tumor. Then, we screened a chemical library of > 1500 FDA-approved drugs and > 25,000 novel compounds in the ZINC database to find established drugs targeting BRAF47-438del and PIK3R1-G376R mutated proteins. Results Several compounds (including anthracyclines) bound with higher affinities than the control drugs (sorafenib and vemurafenib for BRAF and PI-103 and LY-294,002 for PIK3R1). Subsequent cytotoxicity analyses showed that anthracyclines might be suitable drug candidates. Aclarubicin revealed higher cytotoxicity than both sorafenib and vemurafenib, whereas idarubicin and daunorubicin revealed higher cytotoxicity than LY-294,002. Liposomal formulations of anthracyclines may be suitable to cross the blood brain barrier. Conclusions In conclusion, we identified novel small molecules via a drug repurposing approach that could be effectively used for personalized glioblastoma therapy especially for patients carrying BRAF47-438del and PIK3R1-G376R mutations. TEXT: Background Half of the brain tumors represent diffuse gliomas, and the World Health Organization (WHO) provided classification criteria to predict the clinical behavior of these neoplasms [1]. Glioblastoma is classified as grade IV/IV gliomas with specific characteristics, including high cellularity, cellular pleomorphism, nuclear atypia and necrosis [2]. Glioblastoma has a dismal prognosis despite aggressive treatment [2, 3]. Various genetic mutations and aberration have been identified in glioblastoma patients, such as MGMT methylation [3, 4], BRAFG596A [5], BRAFV600E [5\u20137], PIK3R1G376R, PIK3R1D560Y, PIK3R1N564K mutations [8].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597178.0832248}
