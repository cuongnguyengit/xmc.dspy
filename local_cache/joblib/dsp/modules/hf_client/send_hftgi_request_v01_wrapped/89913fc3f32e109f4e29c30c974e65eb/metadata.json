ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs: A Rare Cause of Colonic Mass. ABSTRACT: NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are one of the most used medications worldwide. Every day they are used by more than 30 million Americans. Here, we report a rare and interesting case of a 63-year-old woman with a history of NSAID use who presented to our emergency room with lower abdominal pain. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen with intravenous contrast revealed focal mucosal thickening in the cecum which was highly suspicious for colonic malignancy. She had a colonoscopy which showed two masses and ulcers in the right colon, pathology was negative for malignancy and showed inflammation consistent with NSAID colopathy. TEXT: Introduction NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) use is associated with several adverse effects involving the gastrointestinal tract. NSAID-induced complications involving the stomach and duodenum are well described in the medical literature and are frequently encountered by physicians. In an attempt to decrease gastroduodenal side effects, the use of enteric-coated, sustained-release, or slow-release NSAID may have shifted the damage to the distal small intestine and colon. NSAID causes direct mucosal injury by many mechanisms including interfering with the protective effect of prostaglandins. They are reported to cause erosions, ulcers, hemorrhage, perforations, strictures and the complications of diverticulosis, in the small and large intestine. There is a wide variety of clinical presentations of NSAID-associated gastrointestinal damage ranging from no symptoms to iron deficiency anemia, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding. Here, we report a case of NSAID-induced colopathy mimicking a colonic mass [1, 2]. Case Presentation A 63-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with lower abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting for 3 days. She described the pain as dull, involving the right lower quadrant, non-radiating and constant. She also reported multiple episodes of non-bloody and nonbilious vomiting. Her prior medical problems included osteoarthritis requiring right-sided total knee replacement 5 years prior to this episode. She had been taking ibuprofen 400 mg for knee pain on as needed basis for the past 8 years. She had no family history of inflammatory bowel disease, colon cancer or any other GI-related disorder. She denied smoking, using alcohol and she reported no illicit drug use. She did not have any known drug allergies.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597182.6029677}
