ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Theophylline is a potent adenosine receptor antagonist with indirect adrenergic effects that can lead to arrhythmias and metabolic abnormalities such as hypokalemia. Therapeutic toxicity cases have declined over the years mainly due to decreased recommended therapeutic doses and overall decreased usage of this medication due to newer available COPD treatment options. We present a clinical case of symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia resistant to adenosine therapy in a patient with theophylline use. This case highlights the importance of comprehensive medication review in acute settings to aid in identifying the underlying etiologies and initiating prompt treatments. It also signifies the importance of reviewing chronic medications in each outpatient visits to ensure continued indication for their use and be able to change them to newer agents per guidelines whenever possible. TEXT: 1. Introduction Theophylline is well known for its bronchodilation effects. It is used for pulmonary obstructive disease, severe bradycardia, apnea, and asthma in certain premature and pediatric patients. It is also associated with adrenergic effects that can predispose patients to arrhythmias. We present a case of symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia unresponsive to adenosine. 2. Clinical Case Description A 62-year-old male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, heart failure with persevered ejection fraction (HFpEF), alcohol abuse, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on chronic theophylline presented with epigastric abdominal pain, and vomiting after one day of heavy alcohol drinking. He denied hematemesis, melena, fall, and change in mental status. He was admitted with protocol in place for acute alcohol toxicity and alcohol withdrawal care. His initial presentation was significant for sinus tachycardia that resolved with fluid resuscitation. He had negative troponin values, positive elevated serum alcohol levels, metabolic acidosis, and normal hepatic function enzymes with no signs of acute infection or bleeding.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597026.5446885}
