ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: We report on a pediatric case of hemorrhagic cystitis due to BK virus in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who had undergone bone marrow transplantation. A very large hematoma that almost completely filled the bladder was aspirated using a morcellator via suprapubic percutaneous access, and a thulium laser was then used to cauterize extensive areas of diffuse uroepithelial bleeding. This combined minimally invasive procedure was successful in clearing the bladder hematoma and achieving hemostasis. TEXT: 1 Case report A 4-yr-old boy with relapsing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had undergone allogenic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in August 2020. Starting from the pretransplantation period, he has been receiving a combination of immunosuppressants and chemotherapeutics including anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), etoposide, dexamethasone, and cyclosporine. A regimen of 3 d of equine ATG (30 mg/kg) and 1 wk of dexamethasone (10 mg/m2) was administered intravenously just before BMT. The patient\u2019s post-transplantation immunosuppressive medication comprised a daily dose of oral cyclosporine (15 mg/kg) and mycophenolate mofetil (600 mg/m2) and was supported with intermittent intravenous filgrastim. Subsequently, a broad-spectrum antibiotic and an antifungal agent were added because of fever and related culture results. During the follow-up period, BK virus (BKV) was detected on serum DNA polymerase chain reaction in October 2020, which presented with hemorrhagic cystitis. A total of six doses of intravenous cidofovir were administered at a dose rate of 5 mg/kg twice a weekly. The patient\u2019s serum creatinine and urea levels were elevated at 0.89 mg/dl and 46 mg/dl, respectively. His platelet (75 000 /\u03bcl) and hemoglobin (6.5 g/dl) levels were low. Transfusion with one unit of erithrocytes and eight units of trombocytes was carried out. Urinary ultrasonography revealed a hematoma measuring 4.6 cm \u00d7 3.5 cm \u00d7 4 cm that almost filled the entire bladder lumen (Fig. 1).Fig. 1 Ultrasonographic and cystoscopic views of the bladder hematoma.
