ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: A single dose of pegfilgrastim or the daily administration of colony-stimulating factors can be used to prevent febrile neutropenia. This may delay the detection of rapidly progressive infections among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. We report a case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremic pneumonia that occurred in a patient receiving pegfilgrastim. TEXT: Introduction With the spread of outpatient chemotherapy, pegfilgrastim has been used for the prevention of febrile neutropenia (FN) because its prolonged half-life permits single-dose administration. However, cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are always at risk of invasive infections regardless of the presence of neutropenia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremic pneumonia (PABP) is an infection that is usually fatal, which generally occurs in neutropenic patients undergoing chemotherapy. This is the first report of a case of PABP in a solid cancer patient without neutropenia following outpatient chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim treatment. Case Report A 69-year-old man presented with high fever and general fatigue. He had been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer with multiple lung metastases two and a half years previously. He had been treated with gemcitabine (GEM) for two years and then TS-1 for 1 month. He developed FN after his first course of third-line chemotherapy with navelbine plus GEM due to progressive disease. Thereafter, he received outpatient chemotherapy along with pegfilgrastim. Fourteen days after the fifth course of third-line chemotherapy, he visited the hospital on the date of his scheduled outpatient appointment. He had a high fever (39\u00b0C) and general fatigue and was admitted to hospital with a suspected lung abscess. On admission, the patient had no cough, sputum, dyspnea, chest pain, headache, or vomiting. He had no known contact with sick individuals. A physical examination revealed a body temperature of 39.0\u00b0C, a pulse rate of 66 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and blood pressure of 90/56 mmHg. Lungs auscultation was clear, with the exception of decreased breath sounds in the right lung. No heart murmur was audible. There was mild pitting edema in his lower legs. Chest radiography on arrival showed consolidation in the upper field of the right lung (Fig. 1). Computed tomography (CT) disclosed a cavitary lesion, measuring 45\u00d743 mm, with surrounding inflammation in the right upper lobe (Fig. 2). The laboratory data showed that he did not have neutropenia (white blood cell [WBC] count, 44,700/\u03bcL [neutrophils, 93%]). The other values were as follows: hemoglobin, 8.7 g/dL; platelets, 239,000/\u03bcL; aspirate aminotransferase, 24 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 15 U/L; lactic dehydrogenase, 272 U/L; total protein, 5.3 g/dL; albumin, 2.1 g/dL; creatinine, 0.87 mg/dL; serum urea nitrogen, 26 mg/dL; and C-reactive protein, 7.9 mg/dL.
