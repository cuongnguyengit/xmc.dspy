ABSTRACT: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon and life-threating condition characterized by major immune activation and massive cytokine production by mononuclear inflammatory cells, due to defects in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. It is even more unusual in renal transplant recipients, in which it is often associated with uncontrolled infection. The mortality is high in HLH and differential diagnosis with sepsis is a challenge. The approach and management depend on the underlying trigger and comorbidities. We report a case of a 50-year-old renal transplant female admitted with fever and malaise 3 months post-transplant and presenting anemia, fever, hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of serum ferritin, and positive CMV antigenemia. Urine was positive for decoy cells and BKV-DNA. Graft biopsy showed CMV nephritis. Both blood and urine cultures where positive for E. coli. Hemophagocytosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone, with complete response after 3 weeks. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of a rare and serious condition in a renal transplant patient, which can allow a favorable clinical course and improve survival rate. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) consists of an immune hyperactivation syndrome that takes place when NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to eliminate activated macrophages, leading to over production of proinflammatory cytokines1. There are primary and acquired causes. Primary HLH is rare and typically manifests in childhood because of two autosomal recessive defects in genes that encode proteins involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules during apoptosis in natural killer (NK) cells.1 , 2Acquired (secondary) HLH is triggered by various conditions as infections, immunodeficiency, rheumatologic diseases, and cancer.1 , 3 , 4 Infection is the most common precipitating factor of HLH in adults, mainly viruses of herpes family (EBV, CMV, HSV, HHV8), but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens can also be a trigger.5 , 6 Multiorgan involvement and organomegaly are frequently found and hemophagocytosis results in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of HLH is based on the presence of at least 5 of the following 8 criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting \u2265 2 lineages of peripheral blood cells), hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, serum ferritin >500 ng/mL, low activity of NK cells, soluble CD25 > 2.400 U/mL and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes.7 Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red cells, platelets, or white cells in macrophage cytoplasm visualized in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.2 The syndrome is defined by a complex picture. However, some patients may have incipient or partial disease.1 Most diagnostic\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Anthracyclines constitute the backbone of intensive adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy. Cardiotoxicity is one of its most serious adverse effects, and its incidence increases with cumulative dose. Dexrazoxane is a cardioprotective agent used in conjunction with anthracycline therapy. There is limited data of its usage in adult AML patients. We report the outcomes of six older adults at high risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity who received dexrazoxane during induction/re-induction therapy. Five had preserved left-ventricular function while two proceeded onto stem-cell transplantation. Additional investigation of dexrazoxane in adult leukemia therapy is warranted, particularly in older patients at highest risk for cardiovascular mortality. TEXT: 1 Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for 80% of acute leukemia in adults with a median age at diagnosis of 65 years [1]. The standard upfront induction regimen for fit adult individuals remains \u201c7+3\u201d, consisting of 7 days of continuous infusion cytarabine and 3 days of an anthracycline, either daunorubicin or idarubicin [2]. Variations of induction and re-induction regimens in the refractory/relapsed disease setting often include either idarubicin or mitoxantrone in conjunction with high dose cytarabine and sometimes purine analogues. Medical comorbidities, specifically cardiovascular morbidity, have been shown to negatively impact the clinical outcomes of AML induction therapy in older adults. Cardiotoxicity constitutes the most frequently feared adverse event associated with the use of anthracyclines (>10%), and compromised cardiac function may compromise the use of potentially curative upfront and subsequent AML regimens in a patient's course. Prevention or mitigation of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, particularly in older adults who constitute the majority of new AML diagnoses, is therefore an area of tremendous clinical relevance. Cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines is dose-dependent and can occur at any time in the treatment course with acute, subacute, and late-onset presentations. Clinical symptoms include arrhythmias, myopericarditis, cardiomyopathy, and congestive heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [3], [4], [5]. For example, the incidence of cardiotoxic events with use of doxorubicin was less than 5% at a cumulative dose of 400 mg/m2, but increased in a dose-dependent manner to 16% at a cumulative dose of 500 mg/m2, 26% at 550 mg/m2, and 48% at 700 mg/m2\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596012.4182389}
