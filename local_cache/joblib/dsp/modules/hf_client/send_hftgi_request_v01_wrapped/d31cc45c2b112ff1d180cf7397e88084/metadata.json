ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \u201cI think I\u2019m having a stroke.\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient. We will first look for any mention of medication in the article. Then, we will check for any symptoms or conditions that could be caused by the medication. Finally, we will confirm with the article if the medication was the cause of the symptoms.\\nReactions: hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, pseudo-prolonged QT interval, ST depression, T-U wave fusion, QU interval, absent T wave\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Response of conventional chondrosarcoma to gemcitabine alone: a case report. ABSTRACT: Conventional skeletal chondrosarcoma is a bone neoplasm, which is poorly sensitive to anthracyclines-based chemotherapy. We report on an 18-month-long tumour response to gemcitabine as single agent in a young patient with an advanced secondary peripheral conventional chondrosarcoma, previously treated unsuccessfully with anthracyclines, ifosfamide, platinum, etoposide. TEXT: Background The skeletal chondrosarcoma family represents a heterogeneous group of malignant bone mesenchymal tumours characterised by the production of a chondroid matrix. They are the third bone sarcoma in incidence, and the most frequent in adults. There are three main subtypes: conventional, mesenchymal, and clear-cell. A \u201cdedifferentiated\u201d chondrosarcoma develops in 10-15% of conventional chondrosarcomas, while mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a high-grade, aggressive neoplasm with a natural history and chemosensitivity that might be close to Ewing sarcoma, and clear-cell chondrosarcoma is a low-grade variant [1]. In conventional chondrosarcoma (cCS), the histological malignancy grade is the main prognostic factor [2]. Grade 1 cCS are characterised by a very low metastatic potential, and some authors have quite recently suggested a re-classification of these types as \u201catypical cartilaginous tumours\u201d [1]. Grade 2 and 3 cCS are marked by a higher metastatic potential, with a 10-year survival of 64-86% and 29-55% respectively [3,4]. CCSs are also categorised according to their location in the bone: a central chondrosarcoma onsets in the medullary cavity, a small percentage of them from a pre-existing benign lesion known as enchondroma, while a peripheral variant arises from the surface of the bone, as a result of malignant progression of a pre-existing benign (solitary or hereditary) osteochondroma. Surgery is the mainstay of the treatment of localized disease. While curettage is acceptable for grade 1 cCS, wide excision is usually required for higher grade cCS, with the exception of skull base cCS which may be treated with radiotherapy. In particular, hadrons can play an important role in the management of skull base cCS, and very good outcomes are reported [5].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient. We will first need to identify the drugs mentioned in the article, then we will look for any reported adverse reactions associated with those drugs.\\nReactions: Nausea, vomiting, fatigue, anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, alopecia, mucositis, diarrhea, constipation, fever, infection, neuropathy, rash, myalgia, arthralgia, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, cough, edema, anorexia, weight loss, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, stomatitis, dysphagia, dysgeusia, dry skin, pruritus, nail changes, conjunctivitis, blurred vision\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Low-Charge Electrotherapy in Geriatric Major Depressive Disorder Patients: A Case Series. ABSTRACT: To examine the feasibility of low-charge electrotherapy (LCE) in treating geriatric major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. Bi-temporal LCEs (approximately 25 mC) were performed with an electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) instrument three times per week. We used the Hamilton Depression Scale 17 (HAMD-17) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) to assess the effects of LCE and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to evaluate the cognitive function change before and after LCE. Six visits occurred at the baseline, after LCE sessions 3, 6, and 9, after the last session, and at the end of the one-month follow-up period. Four patients were enrolled in the study. Two patients completed all LCE sessions. Two patients withdrew during the trial, one due to the adverse event of uroschesis potentially caused by atropine and the other due to her own will. All four patients completed the follow-up sessions. The HAMD-17 and HAMA scores were reduced significantly at the last LCE session and the end of the follow-up period compared with the scores at the baseline. As measured by the MMSE, cognitive impairment showed no significant changes at the last LCE session and the end of the follow-up period compared with that at the baseline. In this case series, LCE showed potential as an alternative current-based treatment for treating geriatric MDD patients. Further research is needed to assess the efficiency and safety of LCE. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Geriatric major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most severe health problems in the world. As MDD causes a series of serious problems in elderly patients, rapid remission in geriatric MDD patients is important [1]. Routine first-line procedures, such as antidepressants or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), are insufficient for geriatric MDD patients; 55\u201381% of elderly patients fail to improve with first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) treatments. Electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), the most effective therapy for severe depression, has been used in clinical practice for decades. ECT has shown significant efficacy in geriatric MDD patients [2,3]. However, ECT also has a number of side effects, such as headache, delirium, forgetfulness, and cognitive impairment [1], which are especially severe among geriatric patients [4]. As a result, many elderly patients refuse ECT treatment, leading to a delay in the remission of depression and even loss of life. Some more recent procedures with fewer side effects, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS), are used to treat MDD [1,5,6]. However, these new treatments are less effective than ECT [6-8]. Therefore, improving ECT to retain its therapeutic efficacy while minimizing its side effects will strongly benefit MDD patients.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596431.37489}
