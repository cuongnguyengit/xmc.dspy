ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Pulmonary mucormycosis (PM) is a rare, life-threatening fungal infection usually affecting immunocompromised patients. Its incidence is rising, with a recent outbreak associated with COVID-19 co-infection. Amphotericin B along with early surgery are considered the standard treatment. Recurrence has been reported in patients without adequate treatment and without permanent reversal of predisposing factors. We report a case of late recurrence of PM in a renal transplant recipient. In 2012, he was diagnosed with PM. Imaging at the time showed a lingular mass. He was treated with antifungal for 1 year until complete radiological resolution. Surgical intervention was considered but no further follow-up action was taken. In 2020, he presented with fever and haemoptysis. Imaging again showed a lingular mass, which was confirmed to be PM by bronchoscopic lung biopsy. This case highlights the importance of secondary antifungal prophylaxis for PM if permanent reversal of immunosuppression is not possible. TEXT: pmcINTRODUCTION Pulmonary mucormycosis (PM) is a rare but often fatal fungal disease that is difficult to diagnose and treat. It often affects immunocompromised patients, with diabetes mellitus (DM), glucocorticoid use, haematological malignancies, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation and solid organ transplantation being the most common risk factors. 1 The prevalence of PM is rising, with a recent outbreak associated with COVID\u201019, probably due to immune system dysregulation or widespread use of immunosuppressors. 2 Rhizopus species in the order Mucorales cause most human infections. These fungal organisms are ubiquitous in nature. PM is caused by inhalation of spores, resulting in pneumonia and later necrosis and infarction of the lung tissue. 3 The rate of recurrence of PM is high and has been reported in different literature. 4 , 5 , 6 Here, we report a case of PM in a renal transplant recipient with poorly controlled DM, first diagnosed in 2012 and treated with antifungal for 1 year with radiological resolution. He was not prescribed secondary antifungal prophylaxis and the PM recurred in 2020 at the same site. To prevent recurrence, risk factors for PM, especially DM, should be controlled. Antifungal should be continued until complete response is demonstrated on imaging, and predisposing factors are permanently reversed. 7 CASE REPORT A 51\u2010year\u2010old man presented in September 2020 with a 1\u2010month history of cough, fever and frank haemoptysis.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597047.1574352}
