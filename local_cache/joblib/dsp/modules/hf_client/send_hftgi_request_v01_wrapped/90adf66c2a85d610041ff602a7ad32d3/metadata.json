ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Ceftaroline fosamil is a novel 5th generation broad-spectrum oxyimino-cephalosporin with activity against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Gram-negative bacteria. It has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. There have been reported cases of successful treatment of MRSA bacteremia with this agent. Common adverse drug reactions from ceftaroline include skin rash, hives, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is a rare untoward drug reaction associated with it. We report a case of fever and acute hypoxic respiratory failure with bilateral interstitial pulmonary infiltrates while on ceftaroline therapy for sternal osteomyelitis and ascending aortic graft infection secondary to MRSA. Laboratory studies revealed peripheral blood eosinophilia (>3000 cells/mm3). After exclusion of infectious, autoimmune, and other extrinsic allergic causes of pneumonia, ceftaroline-related acute eosinophilic pneumonia was suspected. Ceftaroline was discontinued and a therapeutic trial of high-dose steroid was initiated. Significant improvement of clinical symptoms and hypoxia was achieved after 24 h of steroid therapy. There was no recurrence of clinical symptoms after completing steroid course, which supported our suspicion of acute eosinophilic pneumonia from ceftaroline. Radiographic improvement of pulmonary infiltrates occurred 4 weeks later with complete resolution at 3 months from the initial event. The current case adds to this rarely reported adverse effect from this relatively newer antimicrobial agent. Increased awareness, early recognition, discontinuation of medication, and steroid therapy are key in favorable clinical outcome and recovery. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Among a wide array of potential adverse drug reactions from ceftaroline, acute eosinophilic pneumonia is probably the most uncommon. Herein, we present the third case of ceftaroline-related acute eosinophilic pneumonia reported in the literature to date.
