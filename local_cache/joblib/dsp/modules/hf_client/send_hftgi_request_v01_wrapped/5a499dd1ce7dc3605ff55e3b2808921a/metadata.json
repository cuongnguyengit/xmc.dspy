ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis in partially immunized immunocompetent child: a case report. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Haemophilus influenzae is a Gram-negative coccobacillus that can cause many different kinds of infection, ranging from mild ear infection to life-threatening diseases like epiglottitis and meningitis. Encapsulated type b Haemophilus influenzae was most commonly responsible for Haemophilus influenzae meningitis in children before introduction of Haemophilus influenzae conjugate vaccine. None or partially immunized children are acquiring meningitis owing to resistant strains of Haemophilus influenzae, namely beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant strain. METHODS We reported the case of a 2-year-old Emirati boy who presented to our emergency department with fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and fluctuating levels of consciousness. He was developmentally normal with no significant past medical history, except he was partially immunized. Earlier, he had been treated for acute gastroenteritis with intravenous fluids and antiemetics in another hospital and was discharged. His parents escorted him to our emergency department as he became very drowsy. Examination revealed that he was in septic shock. He was immediately treated with oxygen, intravenous antibiotics, and fluids after performing septic workup. He was then shifted to intensive care unit. Blood culture and cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain confirmed diagnosis of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae. He was started on intravenous ceftriaxone, acyclovir, and dexamethasone. He still spiked fever after 1 week. Therefore, ceftriaxone was replaced by meropenem. He recovered well with no sequelae. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights atypical presentation of life-threatening illness along with microbial resistance that had positive outcome due to timely diagnosis and aggressive management by a multidisciplinary team.
