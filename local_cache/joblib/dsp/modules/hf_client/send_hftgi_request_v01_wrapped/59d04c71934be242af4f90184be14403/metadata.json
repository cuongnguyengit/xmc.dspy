ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: DOCK8 deficiency is a combined immunodeficiency due to biallelic variants in dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) gene. The disease has a wide clinical spectrum encompassing recurrent infections (candidiasis, viral and bacterial infections), virally driven malignancies and immune dysregulatory features, including autoimmune (cytopenia and vasculitis) as well as allergic disorders (eczema, asthma, and food allergy). Hypomorphic function and somatic reversion of DOCK8 has been reported to result in incomplete phenotype without IgE overproduction. Here we describe a case of DOCK8 deficiency in a 8-year-old Caucasian girl. The patient's disease was initially classified as autoimmune thrombocytopenia, which then evolved toward a combined immunodeficiency phenotype with recurrent infections, persistent EBV infection and lymphoproliferation. Two novel variants (one deletion and one premature stop codon) were characterized, resulting in markedly reduced, but not absent, DOCK8 expression. Somatic reversion of the DOCK8 deletion was identified in T cells. Hypomorphic function and somatic reversion were associated with restricted T cell repertoire, decreased STAT5 phosphorylation and impaired immune synapse functioning in T cells. Although the patient presented with incomplete phenotype (absence of markedly increase IgE and eosinophil count), sclerosing cholangitis was incidentally detected, thus indicating that hypomorphic function and somatic reversion of DOCK8 may delay disease progression but do not necessarily prevent from severe complications. TEXT: Introduction The dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) protein exerts critical roles in both humoral and cellular immune responses. It mediates cell differentiation, survival, adhesion and migration, promoting the immune synapse (IS) by active cytoskeletal response (1\u20134).\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597092.7244885}
