ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: At the end of 2018, South Africa updated its all-oral regimen, to include bedaquiline (BDQ) and 2 months of linezolid (LZD) for all patients initiating the shorter 9-12 months regimen for rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (RR-TB). We assessed a group of patients in rural KwaZulu-Natal for safety and effectiveness of this treatment regimen under programmatic conditions. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis on RR-TB patients treated with a standardized all-oral short regimen between 1 July 2018 and 30 April 2019 in 3 facilities in King Cetshwayo District. An electronic register (EDR web) and facility-based clinical charts were used to collect variables, which were entered into an Epi-Info database. Our cohort included 117 patients; 68.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 59.3-76.3) tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The median time to culture conversion was 56 days (95% CI: 50-57). Treatment success was achieved in 75.2% (95% CI: 66.5-82.3) of patients. Mortality within the cohort was 12.8% (95% CI: 7.8-20.3). Anemia was the most frequent severe adverse event (AE). The median time to develop severe anemia was 7.1 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] 4.0-12.9) after treatment initiation. LZD was interrupted in 25.2% (95% CI: 17.8-34.5) of participants. An all-oral shorter regimen, including BDQ and LZD as core drugs for the treatment of RR-TB, shows good outcomes, in a high HIV burden rural setting. AEs are common, especially for LZD, but could be managed in the program setting. Support is needed when introducing new regimens to train staff in the monitoring, management, and reporting of AEs.
