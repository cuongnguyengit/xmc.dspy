ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Bone marrow necrosis (BMN) is a rare but important complication of hematological malignancies. We report the case of a 52-year-old male patient with a recurrence of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accompanied by BMN. After re-induction therapy, bone marrow aspiration (BMA) and biopsy from the iliac bone showed necrotic cells and eosinophilic debris, respectively. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed heterogeneous signals in the bilateral iliac bone, possibly reflecting various stages of BMN. BMA from the sternum eventually revealed the recurrence of ALL after a few weeks. Comprehensive assessments, including MRI and repeated bone marrow tests, are required when evaluating the underlying hematological malignancies of patients with BMN. TEXT: Introduction Bone marrow necrosis (BMN) is an extremely infrequent phenomenon, defined as necrosis of the myeloid tissue and medullary stroma. The prevalence of BMN was reported to be between 0.3% and 2% antemortem of patients eligible for bone marrow examination, and BMN is often detected on autopsy (1,2). The causes of BMN have been identified, including hematological malignancies, solid tumors, infectious disease, chemical exposure, radiation, sickle cell disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (2-13). Moreover, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accompanied by BMN has been reported to have a poor prognosis (14). The main clinical symptoms of BMN are fever and bone pain. Laboratory findings, such as severe pancytopenia and elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are generally indicative of BMN (1,2). However, these features can be absent in some cases (15). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings can be helpful but are nonspecific in the evaluation of bone marrow disorders (16). The morphological assessment of bone marrow aspirate and the pathological findings of bone marrow biopsy (BMB) specimens are most essential for the diagnosis of BMN. Many hematologists report difficulty in assessing the disease status of hematological malignancies by bone marrow aspiration (BMA) because they cannot obtain appropriate samples in cases of extensive BMN and \u2018dry tap\u2019, defined as failure to obtain bone marrow on attempted marrow aspiration (6). We herein report a case in which an appropriate disease evaluation was performed using bone marrow aspirate obtained from the sternum of a patient with recurrent ALL accompanied by BMN after re-induction therapy. The MRI features of BMN are also taken into consideration.
