ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Anaphylactic Shock Following Nonionic Contrast Medium during Caudal Epidural Injection. ABSTRACT: Caudal epidural injection is a common intervention in patients with low back pain and sciatica. Even though the complications of fluoroscopically directed epidural injections are less frequent than in blind epidural injections, complications due to contrast media can occur. We report a case of anaphylactic shock immediately after injection of an intravenous nonionic contrast medium (iohexol) during the caudal epidural injection for low back pain and sciatica in a patient without a previous allergic history to ionic contrast media (ioxitalamate). Five minutes after the dye was injected, the patient began to experience dizziness, and the systolic blood pressure dropped to 60 mmHg. Subsequently, the patient exhibited a mild drowsy mental state. About 30 minutes after the subcutaneous injection of 0.2 mg epinephrine, the systolic blood pressure increased to 90 mmHg. The patient recovered without any sequela. Life-threatening complications after injection of intravenous contrast medium require immediate treatment. TEXT: The prevalence of chronic spinal pain is gradually increasing in Korea [1]. Epidural injections are commonly used interventions for managing spinal pain. One of these interventions is a caudal block that is commonly performed by physicians and is considered a safe and easy approach, with minimal risk of inadvertent dural puncture [23]. Caudal epidural injections have been reported to be associated with a few complications. Even though the complications of fluoroscopically guided caudal epidural injections are less frequent than in blind epidural injections, caudal epidural injections guided by fluoroscopy are not devoid of complications. The use of contrast media has a risk of adverse effects, from mild rash to fatal anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction that can lead to death [45]. Anaphylactic shock due to contrast medium is a serious but rare complication. We report a case of severe anaphylactic shock caused by a nonionic contrast medium (iohexol) following caudal epidural injection for low back pain and sciatica in a patient without a previous allergic history to ionic contrast media (ioxitalamate). CASE REPORT A 78-year-old woman visited the pain clinic for management of low back pain and sciatica. The patient did not have any underlying disease except for hypertension. The patient recently underwent a caudal epidural block and a transforaminal epidural block 6 times in a year by using an ionic contrast medium (ioxitalamate, Telebrix\u00ae). She underwent a caudal epidural block 4 times, and had no history of allergic reactions to contrast media or other substances. All procedures were performed without complications.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596744.6981668}
