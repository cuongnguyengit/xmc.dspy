ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: A 14-year-old boy presented with a prodromal respiratory infection followed by super refractory status epilepticus. A diagnosis of Febrile Infection-Related Epilepsy Syndrome (FIRES) was made. Initial MRI study and CSF analysis were normal. He required multiple anticonvulsants owing to the refractory nature of the seizures. The course of the illness was rather stormy, laced with various medical problems viz. hepatic dysfunction, sepsis, hemodynamic, and hematological abnormalities which posed several challenges in the management. Hemophagocytic lymphocytic histiocytosis (HLH) was identified as the etiology of the illness and was treated but without success. The case report highlights the several immunomodulatory strategies that were employed to treat the disease, despite which the outcome was unfavorable. TEXT: Key Points Febrile Infection\u2010Related Epilepsy Syndrome (FIRES) presents as a super refractory status epilepticus (SRSE). Management of FIRES may require multiple anticonvulsants and immunomodulatory strategies. Multiple medical problems could be faced during the management of such a patient, related to both the presentation ie FIRES and its etiology, namely hemophagocytic lymphocytic histiocytosis (HLH). Pursuit of etiology, as for instance HLH in this case, is important from the therapeutic point of view. Early and aggressive management is of paramount importance in this difficult\u2010to\u2010treat disorder. 1 INTRODUCTION Febrile Infection\u2010Related Epilepsy Syndrome or FIRES is a potentially devastating disease characterized by refractory status epilepticus that occurs following an apparently innocuous febrile illness in previously healthy people, usually children of school\u2010going age. 1 We report a patient with the syndrome in whom an unusual etiology was found, and the patient succumbed despite appropriate management strategies. We discuss here the potential difficulties faced during the management of the patient. 2 CASE REPORT A 14\u2010year\u2010old boy was admitted with a seizure. He first experienced throat pain and rhinorrhea 9 days before this presentation and was treated with amoxicillin\u2010clavulanate. Seven days before this admission he started experiencing fever followed by headache and vomiting. Since six days, there was history of decline in food intake. He progressively worsened. A few hours before this admission, he experienced a seizure characterized by sudden alteration of sensorium followed by tonic posturing of neck, face, and hand with deviation of face to the right side. Seizure lasted less than a minute, and he remained in altered sensorium since. He had no comorbidities earlier. Birth, development, and immunization history were unremarkable and family history was negative for any similar or severe illnesses.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597105.0358524}
