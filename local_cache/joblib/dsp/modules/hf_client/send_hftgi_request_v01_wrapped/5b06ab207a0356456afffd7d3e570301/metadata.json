ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: MRSA enterocolitis is under-recognized in the setting of PCR testing. In this case report, we describe risk factors, the importance of stool culture, and the third published case of MRSA enterocolitis in a patient with leukemia. In addition, we performed a retrospective analysis of all stool cultures at our institution that have grown Staphylococcus aureus, and we describe an additional five cases. We also report the diagnostic yield of organisms detected by culture, but not on the FilmArray panel. While rare, these cases demonstrate that MRSA in stool may indicate a severe and potentially life-threatening infection, particularly in immunocompromised persons. TEXT: 1 Introduction Confirmed fatal infection with enterocolitis from methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has rarely been reported in the US. The present case demonstrates the importance of recognizing MRSA as a potential pathogen in the setting of neutropenic enterocolitis during induction chemotherapy and the continued importance of stool culture in the era of molecular diagnostics. 2 Case report A 72-year-old man with a history of clinically quiescent Crohn's disease presented to the emergency department with fever, fatigue, altered mental status, and nausea/vomiting four days after a new diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (Fig. 1A). He had tumor lysis syndrome with acute kidney injury (AKI) and hyperleukocytosis and required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Given the initial diagnostic uncertainty regarding whether his multi-organ failure was related to tumor lysis or infection, he was also treated empirically with ceftazidime and vancomycin for possible septic shock. Antibiotic infusions were separated by over 12 h so that co-mixing was avoided [1]. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis was unremarkable. He became neutropenic after cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea and cytarabine, and defervesced after receiving dose-reduced G-CLAM (filgrastim, cladribine, cytarabine, and mitoxantrone). Ceftazidime was continued for neutropenic prophylaxis, and vancomycin was stopped given the lack of evidence for active infection. Five days later, he again fevered. The following day, he reported mild abdominal pain and new diarrhea. In the setting of febrile neutropenia, an enteric pathogen panel was obtained. This panel consisted of a rapid PCR using the Biofire FilmArray GI panel for 13 bacteria, 4 parasites, and 5 viruses, plus a blood agar plate, primarily for the detection of Aeromonas spp. Reflexive susceptibility testing for Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, and Vibrio species is performed if these organisms are detected on the PCR panel. No pathogens were detected by PCR, and loperamide was started. Two days later, the blood agar plate showed 4+ MRSA with reduced normal fecal flora\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597192.6280518}
