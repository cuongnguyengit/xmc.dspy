ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Primary central nervous system Hodgkin's lymphoma (CNS-HL) is extremely rare. This current case report describes a 60-year-old male patient that presented with numbness of the left lower extremity and worsening headache. After a full range of investigations and a partial resection of the right cerebellum, external ventricular drainage reservoir placement and cranioplasty, he was diagnosed with primary CNS-HL. The patient was treated with 3 g/m2 methotrexate (intravenous [i.v.], once a day, day 1) and 1 g/m2 cytarabine (i.v., every 12 h, days 2 + 3), followed by anti-programmed cell death protein 1 antibodies (200 mg sintilimab, i.v., once a day, day 1, every 3 weeks). After six courses of treatment with intrathecal injections of 50 mg cytarabine (once a day, day 1) and 5 mg dexamethasone (once a day, day 1), there was no residual lesion on cranial magnetic resonance imaging. No significant drug-related adverse events were observed. The patient has been followed up every 3 months and no relapse has occurred. TEXT: Introduction Primary central nervous system Hodgkin's lymphoma (CNS-HL) is rare, with only two of 14 868 cases with CNS involvement reported in the recent literature.1 The incidence of CNS involvement was as low as 0.02%.2,3 Primary CNS-HL is extremely rare and only 22 cases have been reported in the literature.4 To date, the longest survival time reported was 9 years.5 There is no consensus on diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of primary CNS-HL because the incidence is so low that large-scale clinical trials cannot be carried out.
