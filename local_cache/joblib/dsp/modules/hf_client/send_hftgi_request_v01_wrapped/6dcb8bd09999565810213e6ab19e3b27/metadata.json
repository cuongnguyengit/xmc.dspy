ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, also known as Rosai-Dorfman disease, is a rare proliferation of non-Langerhans histiocytes. Cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare subtype of Rosai-Dorfman disease limited to the skin with variable clinical presentation. A 59-year-old female with a history of osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, and follicular B-cell lymphoma presented with pruritic, erythematous, dome-shaped papules that developed while on chemotherapy treatment. During cutaneous disease progression, the patient was further diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome. Histology review revealed patchy staining for S100 in the CD68+ histiocytes within the dermis with no enlarged histiocytes or emperipolesis. Given the absence of other findings, this was interpreted as cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease. There is still little known about the aetiology and pathogenesis of cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease. Non-specific immunohistochemistry in the midst of lymphoma, immunosuppressive treatments, and myelodysplastic syndrome produced a blurred diagnostic picture and delayed appropriate treatment, highlighting the diagnostic challenges of cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy, also known as Rosai\u2013Dorfman disease (RDD), is a rare proliferation of non-Langerhans histiocytes, most commonly involving lymph node sinuses. It was first described as a unique entity in 1969 by Rosai and Dorfman, presenting insidiously with prominent painless cervical lymphadenopathy, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, fever, anaemia, and hypergammaglobulinaemia.1 A rare subtype of RDD, known as cutaneous Rosai\u2013Dorfman disease (CRDD), involves histiocytic proliferation limited to the skin, without concomitant involvement of other sites. The clinical presentation of CRDD varies greatly and as such is often difficult to diagnose.2,3 The majority of patients present with multiple lesions, commonly nodules, plaques, and/or papules, being protean in nature. The aetiology and pathogenesis of the systemic and purely cutaneous forms of RDD remain unknown, although there have been numerous proposed theories, including monocyte stimulation by macrophage colony stimulating factor leading to histiocytes in CRDD, and infectious trigger such as Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV), HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV), and human herpesvirus-6 in the presence of immune system anomalies such as uveitis, Crohn\u2019s disease, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, factor XII deficiency, and lupus erythematosus.4 Despite the uncertain origin of presentation, immunohistochemistry allows for recognition and diagnosis of this rare disease.2,4 Classic histological findings of CRDD include large foamy histiocytes, emperipolesis, and immunophenotype S100+, CD68+, and CD1a\u2212.4\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597049.9208264}
