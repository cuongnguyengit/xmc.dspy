ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Fingolimod (FTY) is a disease modifying therapy for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) which can lead to severe lymphopenia requiring therapy discontinuation in order to avoid adverse events. However, this can result in severe disease reactivation occasionally presenting with tumefactive demyelinating lesions (TDLs). TDLs, which are thought to originate from a massive re-entry of activated lymphocytes into the central nervous system, are larger than 2 cm in diameter and may feature mass effect, perifocal edema, and gadolinium enhancement. In these cases, it can be challenging to exclude important differential diagnoses for TDLs such as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) or other opportunistic infections. Here, we present the case of a 26-year-old female patient who suffered a massive rebound with TDLs following FTY discontinuation with primarily neuropsychiatric symptoms despite persisting lymphopenia. Two cycles of seven plasmaphereses each were necessary to achieve remission and ocrelizumab was used for long-term stabilization. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Fingolimod (FTY), an effective oral disease modifying therapy (DMT) for relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), sequesters lymphocytes in lymphatic tissue such as the lymph nodes. Accordingly, in some cases it can lead to severe lymphopenia. This prompts many neurologists to discontinue therapy in order to avoid opportunistic infections even though clear proof of such a risk is still lacking (1). Since 2012, several cases have been reported describing severe disease reactivation following FTY withdrawal featuring tumefactive demyelinating lesions (TDLs) (2, 3). TDLs are defined as demyelinating lesions larger than 2 cm in diameter and may feature mass effect, perifocal edema and gadolinium (Gad) enhancement (4). Important differential diagnoses for TDLs are progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and/or opportunistic infections. In almost, all of these cases disease reactivation is accompanied by rapid lymphocyte reconstitution. Here, we present the case of a 26-year-old female patient (after obtaining written and informed consent) who suffered a massive rebound with subcortical edematous TDLs after FTY discontinuation due to lymphopenia which persisted for more than 6 weeks after therapy was halted. Her clinical symptoms were primarily neuropsychiatric including affective incontinence and motoric aphasia. To our knowledge, only one similar case was reported in the literature by Ashtari et al. (3).
