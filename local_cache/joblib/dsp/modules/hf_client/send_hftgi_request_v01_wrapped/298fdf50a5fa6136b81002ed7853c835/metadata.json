ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Multiple studies and reports have suggested that coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) promotes arterial and venous thrombotic events in multiple organ systems, although the mechanism leading to a hypercoagulable state is still unknown. Few cases of splenic infarction associated with COVID-19 have been reported, of which half were found incidentally upon autopsy. This may be due to a clinically silent presentation or the symptoms being wrongfully attributed to pain caused by the effects of COVID-19. Due to the rarity of the condition and its lack of consistent symptomatology, splenic thromboembolism can be difficult to diagnose. Awareness of the condition and high clinical suspicion will help the clinician identify and manage the problem. Hemorrhage in patients with COVID-19 is uncommon in the hypercoagulable state that threatens thrombus formation in patients with COVID-19 infection. Despite prophylactic treatment with anticoagulation therapies, patients are more prone to developing clots. It is also well-known that therapeutic anticoagulation can place patients at a higher risk of bleeding. Thus, this unique population is at risk of developing both thrombotic and hemorrhagic events. We report a rare case of splenic infarction in a patient with confirmed COVID-19 infection despite prophylactic treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin which was found incidentally during workup for 2 other rare conditions: spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma and microhemorrhage or thrombus of the mesenteric vessels.
