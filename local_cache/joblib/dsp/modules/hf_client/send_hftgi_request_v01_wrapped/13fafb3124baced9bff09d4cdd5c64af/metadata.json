ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Disseminated Carcinomatosis of Bone Marrow as the Initial Presentation of Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma Without Jaundice: An Autopsy Case Report. ABSTRACT: Disseminated carcinomatosis of the bone marrow (DCBM) is often accompanied by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and has a poor prognosis. DCBM develops most frequently in gastric cancer and is rarely associated with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. A 41-year-old man was incidentally found to have DIC on his regular visit for ulcerative colitis and was diagnosed with DCBM with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. He received intensive care, including chemotherapy, but died suddenly from hyperkalemia, possibly due to tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). The autopsy showed the periductal infiltrating type of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and tumor necrosis, possibly due to chemotherapy, indicating the effectiveness of chemotherapy for DCBM with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Disseminated carcinomatosis of the bone marrow (DCBM) is caused by diffuse infiltration of the bone marrow by malignant tumors and is often associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). It is characterized by three main symptoms (anemia, lower back pain, and bleeding tendency) and elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (1). The prognosis of patients with DCBM is generally poor (2). DCBM develops most frequently in gastric cancer among solid tumors (3). However, DCBM from intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is extremely rare, and our search of the literature revealed no reports of DCBM arising from cholangiocarcinoma. Cases of the periductal infiltrative type intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma without jaundice have also not been reported. We herein report an autopsy case of a 41-year-old man who had DCBM associated with the periductal infiltrative type of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma without jaundice. Case Report A 41-year-old man patient visited our hospital with a 2-month history of diarrhea and 3-week history of bloody stool. He had a history of autoimmune hepatitis that had developed 15 years ago and had been treated with 25 mg/day prednisolone orally. He had been in complete remission for his autoimmune hepatitis. Based on the clinical findings, including total colonoscopy, we diagnosed the patient with ulcerative colitis, and he was initially treated with 5-aminosalicylic acid orally. Subsequently, he was prescribed oral amoxicillin, tetracycline and metronidazole (ATM therapy). His clinical condition improved by these medications.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597078.5091825}
