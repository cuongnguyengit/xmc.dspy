ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Recurrent Erythema Annulare Centrifugum due to Influenza Type A. ABSTRACT: Erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC) is a rare erythema characterized by erythematous and urticarial papules or annular plaques that enlarges centrifugally. The lesions usually involve the thighs and the legs. Several disorders are occasionally associated with EAC, infections, including mycoses, bacteria, or viruses and drugs have also been regarded as possible causes of this eruption. We present a 42-year-old dark-skinned woman affected by recurrent EAC that appeared secondary to influenza type A (H1N1). Histopathology showed a superficial form of EAC. In our case, a previous cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection were identified and no underlying other diseases were found. Clarithromycin with calcipotriol betamethasone treatment was temporarily efficacious. In the last 3 years, the lesions started to appear every 2 weeks and tended to regress with local treatment after a variable period. We believe that the latent cytomegalovirus and the reactivity induced by EBV combined with influenza can determine, in our case, a cell mediate cutaneous immune response, which leads to the peculiar inflammatory disease known as EAC. TEXT: Introduction Erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC) is a reactive disorder that appears as urticarial-like papules and erythematous plaques with crusts or vesicles that enlarge by peripheral extension with central clearing, resulting in annular or polycyclic appearance. EAC is a relatively rare inflammatory disorder described by Darier in the annular erythema's group. EAC secondary to influenza A in a dark-skinned woman was never described in this condition. Infectious diseases, drug use, systemic diseases, autoimmune disorders, and internal malignancies are occasionally associated [1].
