ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \u201cI think I\u2019m having a stroke.\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient. We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Hypokalemic paralysis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, thiazide diuretics, alcohol abuse, anxiety, hypertension\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Frequent ventricular extrasystoles after heart transplantation: a late presentation of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis: a case report. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND There is a lack of information about a mixed type of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) after heart transplantation (HTx) with no amiodarone treatment in almost 1 year. Frequent ventricular extrasystoles (VES) associated with a mixed type of AIT can often be treated using thiamazole and prednisolone, without the need for specific antiarrhythmic treatment. METHODS We present a clinical case of a 65-year-old heart transplanted male patient with frequent VES associated with mixed type of AIT. Recipient had managed with amiodarone prior to HTx but there were no indications for it after the surgery. One year after antiarrhythmic treatment was discontinued, monomorphic VES (total amount: 27 472/day) were diagnosed. In addition, our investigation revealed that thyrotoxicosis developed. Prednisolone and thiamazole were added to the treatment with positive outcomes. The antithyroid treatment had been discontinued after 9 months and results of the 24-h Holter electrocardiogram monitoring showed only two VES/24 h. CONCLUSIONS The case highlights the association of amiodarone, thyroid disorders, and VES. In mixed type AIT or if diagnosis is uncertain, it is reasonable to use mixed therapy. Next is to decide whether you need special treatment for VES. There was no evidence of ventricular tachycardia. Thyroid function tests remained normal off antithyroid medications and the total amount of VES significantly decreased. There were no indications for any antiarrhythmic treatment or ablation. TEXT: Learning points In patients who have been treated with amiodarone prior to heart transplantation, should be periodically screened for thyroid disorders to promptly diagnosed delayed onset amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction. It is important to consider the mixed type of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis in borderline cases. Introduction Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction develops in 15\u201320% of patients under amiodarone therapy.1 Two main forms of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) may occur: Type 1 is a form of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism occurring in patients with underlying thyroid abnormalities, and Type 2 is a destructive thyroiditis mainly due to direct cytotoxic effects of amiodarone on thyroid follicular cells of a normal thyroid gland.2 At the same time, AIT Type 2 generally develops in patients without clinical, biochemical, and morphological evidence of thyroid disease.3 One study showed that despite discontinuation of amiodarone treatment at the time of the heart transplantation (HTx) procedure, patients remain at risk for developing mixed thyroid disease. Heart transplanted recipients treated with amiodarone before HTx should, therefore, be monitored carefully for a development of thyroid dysfunction, especially within the first post-transplant year.4 Timeline\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596819.1868918}
