ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: The programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, has subsequently been approved for the treatment of a wide variety of malignant tumors. Compared with conventional chemotherapy, immunotherapy is associated with a unique set of immune reactions, known collectively as immune-related adverse events. Although often mild, dermatologic toxicity can occasionally be high grade and potentially life-threatening. Here we describe a rare case of bullous pemphigoid (BP) associated with pembrolizumab. A 79-year-old male patient presented with scattered erythema, papules, blisters, and pruritus after pembrolizumab treatment. Then, the rash gradually aggravated and spread to the whole body. The extensive edematous erythema, blisters, bullae, and blood blisters were loose and easy to rupture, forming an erosive surface and with pruritus and obvious pain. The hemidesmosomal protein BP180 (type XVII collagen) was detectable in the serum, and the histological examination diagnosis was bullous pemphigoid. After 10 days of glucocorticoid (methylprednisolone, iv, 80 mg/day) treatment, new blister formation ceased. We need to increase the awareness on and facilitate the earlier identification of the cutaneous adverse effects of BP with immunotherapy so that treat can begin early in order to limit the duration and severity of toxicity. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody IgG4 programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antagonist. As a new drug of immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab has shown great promising prospects in clinical antitumor immunotherapy and has rapidly become the first-line therapy for a variety of advanced malignancies. It has been recommended in antitumor guidelines of many countries and opened a new era of tumor immunotherapy (1). While immune checkpoint inhibitors can enhance the immune system and cause cells to attack tumor cells, they can also cause cells to attack normal cells in the body, causing a series of inflammatory diseases mimicking autoimmune diseases, some of which may be serious. These major adverse effects are termed \u201cimmune-related adverse events\u201d (irAEs) and present with organ-specific tissue inflammation (2\u20134). Here we report a case of bullous pemphigoid (BP) associated with pembrolizumab, emerging with a potentially serious dermatologic toxicity, and we will use this case to highlight the diagnosis and management of cutaneous irAEs associated with checkpoint inhibitors.
