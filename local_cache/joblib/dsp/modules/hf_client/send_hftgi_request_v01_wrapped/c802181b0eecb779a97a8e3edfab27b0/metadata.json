ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Post-cardiac injury syndrome, including pleural effusion as a delayed complication of permanent pacemaker implantation, has rarely been reported. To resolve pleural effusion, prolonged chest tube placement is often required. Anti-inflammatory agents combined with diuretics are also often prescribed. Saireito, a Japanese herbal medication, which is a combination of Goreisan and Shousaikoto, has both anti-inflammatory and water-modulation properties and has been used for edema (lymph edema, cerebral edema) and inflammation (chronic nephritis). CASE REPORT We describe a 71-year-old woman with a history of syncope and bradycardia who underwent dual permanent pacemaker implantation (placed in the right chest because of a persistent left superior vena cava) without complications. Two months later, she came to the hospital as an outpatient with a dry cough, and was diagnosed with right-sided pleural effusion. A pleural fluid analysis revealed exudative effusion, according to Light's criteria. The fluid was negative for infectious etiology. Chest X-ray, computed tomography, and echocardiography revealed no signs of pericardial effusion or perforation of the pacemaker lead to outside the heart. The pleural effusion persisted despite use of anti-inflammatory medication for several weeks and diuretics for a short period. Saireito was administered with good response; the pleural effusion resolved completely and there was no deterioration of renal function. CONCLUSIONS The present case highlights the clinical significance of Saireito as an effective therapeutic agent for late-onset pacemaker-related pleural effusion, without adverse effects such as renal dysfunction. TEXT: pmcBackground Pacemaker implantation is a standard and safe therapeutic strategy for patients of all ages with bradyarrhythmia. Various complications associated with pacemaker implantation are common, but late-onset pacemaker-related pleural effusion is rarely reported [1]. Recently, Xiong et al reported 6 consecutive elderly patients with pleural effusion who had undergone a new pacemaker implantation and evaluated the clinical characteristics and therapeutic courses of pleural effusion [2]. According to their report, cases of late-onset pacemaker-related pleural effusion were treatment-resistant; patients had to be hospitalized repeatedly with thoracentesis because conventional treatments including diuretics and anti-inflammatory agents had only short-term effects, similar to a case reported by Shaukat et al [3].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597191.0385928}
