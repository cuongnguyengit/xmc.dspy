ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Reactivation of Chagas Disease in a Patient With an Autoimmune Rheumatic Disease: Case Report and Review of the Literature. ABSTRACT: Reactivation of Chagas disease has been described in immunosuppressed patients, but there is a paucity of literature describing reactivation in patients on immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of autoimmune rheumatic diseases. We describe a case of Chagas disease reactivation in a woman taking azathioprine and prednisone for limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc). Reactivation manifested as indurated and erythematous cutaneous nodules. Sequencing of a skin biopsy specimen confirmed the diagnosis of Chagas disease. She was treated with benznidazole with clinical improvement in the cutaneous lesions. However, her clinical course was complicated and included disseminated CMV disease and subsequent septic shock due to bacteremia. Our case and review of the literature highlight that screening for Chagas disease should be strongly considered for patients who will undergo immunosuppression for treatment of autoimmune disease if epidemiologically indicated. TEXT: PATIENT CASE An 86-year-old woman developed painful subcutaneous nodules on her medial thighs and left upper extremity (Figure 1A, B). Over the ensuing 2 months, the nodules enlarged and became more indurated, erythematous, and painful. She also developed night sweats, fatigue, diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss. Figure 1. A, Skin lesions on left medial thigh. B, Skin lesions on right medial thigh. The patient had a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc; a multisystem autoimmune rheumatic disease), manifested as pulmonary hypertension and Reynaud\u2019s syndrome. Eight months before admission, she was diagnosed with tachy-brady syndrome, requiring a pacemaker. Echocardiogram at that time showed a dilated right ventricle with elevated pressures, preservation of left ventricle ejection fraction, and no wall motion abnormalities or apical aneurysms. For management of lcSSc, she had been on long-standing azathioprine (100 mg/d). Prednisone (15 mg/d) was added 3 months before the current presentation for management of a diagnosis of retinal vasculitis. The patient was born and raised in a rural mountain village near Trujillo, Venezuela. As a child, she lived in a mud hut and cared for many animals including chickens, dogs, and cats. At 20 years of age, she emigrated to the United States. She traveled back to Venezuela only once at 70 years of age, and otherwise denied international travel.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597026.5972464}
