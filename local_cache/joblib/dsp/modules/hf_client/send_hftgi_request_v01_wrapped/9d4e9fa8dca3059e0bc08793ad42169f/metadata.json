ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Association of immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy, in sequence or as single therapies, may induce osteonecrosis of the jaw. Multidisciplinary team management of these patients should be provided. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION The number of medication which may cause osteonecrosis of the jaws is increasing. Up until now, Ipilimumab has been associated with MRONJ only two times in literature. A woman underwent endovenous chemotherapy with ipilimumab in 2015 for metastatic melanoma. In 2018, while she was undergoing target therapy (vemurafenib + cobimetinib), after wisdom tooth extraction, she developed MRONJ. She was successfully treated with medical therapy alone. Ongoing target therapy may have played a role in MRONJ late onset. Caution and vigilance in dental management of patients treated with novel MRONJ\u2010related chemotherapy are needed. A multidisciplinary evaluation is advised. First reported cases of nonhealing\u2010exposed bone in the maxillofacial region were recognized by oral and maxillofacial surgeons in patients treated with intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates (BP). 1 During 2004, Novartis, manufacturer of pamidronate (Aredia) and zoledronic acid (Zometa)\u2014two IV BPs\u2014labeled this product as at risk for osteonecrosis of the jaws (ONJ). 2 Consequently, the subsequent year a warning followed for all BP drug class to be at risk for ONJ, which was renamed as bisphosphonate\u2010related ONJ (BRONJ). 3 Since then, other BPs and medications from other classes have been related to the development of ONJ, including denosumab (humanized monoclonal antibody blocking the activation of receptors for nuclear factor \u03ba\u03b2 ligand), bevacizumab (humanized monoclonal antibody), and antiangiogenic medications\u2014sunitinib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor). 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 Additionally, case reports have indicated possible association between ONJ and azacitidine, imatinib, everolimus, ziv\u2010aflibercept, ipilimumab, and tocilizumab. 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 With the advent of these new classes of medications, the condition is now more aptly known as medication\u2010related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). 1 Both pathogenesis and associated risk factors not fully comprehended. This majorly reflects on its therapy as indications for surgery (sequestrectomy/curettage with possible reconstruction) vs antibiotic medical therapy (3 g amoxicillin + 1.5 metronidazole per os per day for at least 2 weeks) are still unclear and so great effort is also put in studying and developing complementary treatments, including application of platelet concentrates, ozone therapy, and laser treatment, in order both to prevent MRONJ and to improve healing after surgical treatment of such lesions. 19\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597184.7204752}
