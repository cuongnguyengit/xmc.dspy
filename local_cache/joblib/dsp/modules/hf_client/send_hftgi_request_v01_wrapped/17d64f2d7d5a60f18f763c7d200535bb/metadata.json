ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND To summarize the characteristics of gastrointestinal (GI) perforation in anti-nuclear matrix protein 2 (NXP2) antibody-associated juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM). METHODS Five patients with GI perforation from a JDM cohort of 120 cases are described. Relevant literature was reviewed. RESULTS Five patients, including four females and one male, were included in the study. The age of onset of these patients ranged from 3.3 to 9.5 years with the median age of 5.0 years. When these patients were complicated by GI perforation, childhood myositis assessment score (CMAS) ranged from 1 to 5 with the median score of 2. Myositis-specific antibody (MSA) spectrum analysis indicated that the five patients were anti-NXP2 antibody positive. The initial symptoms of GI perforation were progressive abdominal pain and intermittent fever. Two patients also presented with ureteral calculus with hydronephrosis and ureteral stricture. Surgery was performed in four patients. One patient failed to undergo a repair as the perforation was high in position. For the other three patients, perforation repair was successful, of which two patients failed due to recurrent perforation. At 24 months postoperative follow-up, one patient was in complete remission on prednisone (Pred) and methotrexate (MTX) treatment, and her ureteral stricture had disappeared. The other four patients died. Adding these cases with 16 other patients described in the literature, the symptom at onset was progressive abdominal pain, which often occurred within 10 months after JDM was diagnosed. Perforation most commonly occurred in the duodenum, although it also occurred at multiple sites or was recurrent. The mortality rate of GI perforation in JDM was 38% (8/21). CONCLUSIONS All the five perforation cases in our study subjected to MSA analysis were anti-NXP2 antibody positive. The symptom at onset was abdominal pain. The most common site of perforation was the duodenum in the retroperitoneum, and the lack of acute abdominal manifestations prevented early diagnosis. GI perforation may be a fatal complication in JDM, and early diagnosis is very important. More research is needed to determine the pathogenesis and predictive factors of GI perforation in JDM.
