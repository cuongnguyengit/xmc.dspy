ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Ethylene glycol is commonly used in antifreeze, and ingestion of even a small amount can result in acute kidney injury, severe metabolic acidosis, and neurological injury. When cases are recognized early, treatment involves administration of alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitors to prevent conversion to toxic metabolites of glycolate, glyoxolate, and oxalate. In later presentations with more severe renal injury, hemodialysis may be required for clearance of toxic metabolites and supportive care for renal failure. We present the first reported case of severe ethylene glycol intoxication requiring support of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to refractory cardiopulmonary collapse. TEXT: pmc1. Introduction Ethylene glycol is present in several commonly available commercial products, notably automotive antifreeze, and cases of toxic ingestion have been reported as far back as the 1930s [1]. More recently, the 2019 Annual Report by the National Poison Data System (NPDS) recorded 7,260 cases of ethylene glycol intoxication, of which 874 were intentional, 2,287 received medical treatment, and 19 resulted in death [2]. Although ethylene glycol as a parent alcohol is relatively nontoxic, its metabolites\u2014glycolate, glyoxylate, and oxalate\u2014are nephrotoxic [3]. Oxalate inflicts damage via the formation of calcium oxalate crystals that cause tubular obstruction and hypocalcemia. This pathway is summarized in Figure 1. A peak serum concentration of 20 mg/dL is considered toxic and generally requires medical treatment, although case reports describe volumes as low as 20-30 mL, approximately one mouthful of antifreeze, to have caused somnolence and acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring dialysis [4]. In general, treatment focuses on alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition and supportive measures for AKI and acidosis, though in severe cases, hemodialysis may be required to facilitate clearance of both ethylene glycol and its metabolites. Rarely, cases may be severe enough to warrant more intensive supportive measures. Here, we report a dramatic case of ethylene glycol intoxication requiring the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). 2.
