ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that occurs in patients who are elderly and immunocompromised. The most common treatment for PCNSL is high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy. Studies have suggested that the radiological response to high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy is associated with improved neurocognitive ability that remains stable upon follow-up. However, no study involving patients with an extremely poor neurological status before chemotherapy initiation has been reported, and the neurological prognosis of this group of patients remains unknown. The current case study described 3 patients with PCNSL diagnosed via biopsy who had comatose neurological states due to disease progression prior to treatment. All patients were treated with high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy. However, although effective radiological responses to treatment were achieved, no meaningful neurological or cognitive recovery was documented. Patients with PCNSL exhibiting a baseline comatose state have a poor neurological prognosis even with an effective tumour response to chemotherapy. Therefore, rapid detection and prompt treatment are crucial in patients with this disease. TEXT: Introduction Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that is usually confined to the brain, leptomeninges, spine, cerebrospinal fluid and eyes without evidence of systemic spread (1). PCNSL represents approximately 4% of all newly diagnosed central nervous system (CNS) tumours (2,3), and most seem to be of late or post-germinal centre B-cell origin (4,5). Immunodeficiency due to congenital immunodeficiency syndromes such as ataxia-telangiectasia and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, as well as secondary causes such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and iatrogenic immunosuppression for transplant procedures, has been implicated in the development of PCNSL (6).\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597138.572514}
