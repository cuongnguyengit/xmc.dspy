ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Heart transplant recipients represent a particularly vulnerable patient population to the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to chronic immunosuppression and high rates of comorbidities. Currently, data are limited and evidence to guide management of heart transplant recipients with COVID-19 is sparse. In this case report, we provide a summary of the current literature as well as an in-depth analysis of our clinical decision-making. A 67-year-old female who underwent cardiac transplantation 1 year prior was found to have acute hypoxic respiratory failure due to COVID-19. Her immunosuppressant medications were modulated with discontinuation of mycophenolate and titration of tacrolimus troughs with a goal of 6-10 ng/dL. She was administered supportive treatment including convalescent plasma, remdesivir, and dexamethasone, in addition to antibiotic treatment that resulted in resolution of her symptoms within a matter of days despite her precarious disposition. This case demonstrates that it can be safe and efficacious to modulate immunosuppressant medications in cardiac transplant recipients in accordance with recommendations made by the International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation. This case additionally demonstrates that aspects of the current literature regarding the management of COVID-19 can be safely extrapolated to cardiac transplant recipients. Providing supportive care with dexamethasone, remdesivir, and convalescent plasma as indicated can be beneficial in cardiac transplant recipients; although, the current literature regarding convalescent plasma and remdesivir is conflicting. TEXT: Learning points Modifying immunosuppressant agents in line with recommendations made by International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation can be safe and efficacious. Due to the lack of data regarding management of coronavirus disease 2019 infection in cardiac transplant patients, cautious extrapolation of the current literature may be made. Providing supportive care with dexamethasone, remdesivir, antibiotic therapy, and convalescent plasma as indicated can be beneficial in cardiac transplant recipients; although, the current literature regarding convalescent plasma is conflicting.
