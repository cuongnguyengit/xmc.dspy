ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Additional therapeutic options are needed for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). We present data from a phase 1b, open-label, dose-escalation study (NCT01965353) of 20 patients with RRMM (median age: 63 years [range: 50-77]) and a median of four prior regimens (range: 2-14); 85% had refractory disease (lenalidomide [80%]; bortezomib [75%]; lenalidomide and bortezomib [50%]). Patients received a median of six cycles (range: 1-74) of panobinostat (10 or 15 mg), lenalidomide 15 mg, bortezomib 1 mg/m2, and dexamethasone 20 mg (pano-RVd). Median follow-up was ~14 months. Six dose-limiting toxicities were reported (mostly hematological); maximum tolerated dose of panobinostat (primary endpoint) was 10 mg. Most common adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea (60%) and peripheral neuropathy (60%); all grade 1/2. Grade 3/4 AEs occurred in 80% of patients and included decreased neutrophil (45%), platelet (25%) and white blood cell (25%) counts, anemia (25%) and hypophosphatemia (25%). No treatment-related discontinuations or mortality occurred. In evaluable patients (n = 18), overall response rate was 44%, and clinical benefit rate was 61%. Median duration of response was 9.2 months; progression-free survival was 7.4 months; overall survival was not reached. Pano-RVd proved generally well-tolerated and demonstrated potential to overcome lenalidomide and/or bortezomib resistance. TEXT: Introduction Treatment of multiple myeloma (MM), an incurable plasma-cell neoplasm, has changed substantially in recent decades1. Rapidly evolving treatment standards have led to improvements in overall survival (OS), as well as the depth and duration of response (DOR)2\u20134. Nevertheless, most patients ultimately relapse and require subsequent lines of therapy, with the depth of response and DOR to each successive regimen typically decreasing over time1. However, different emerging classes of agents, which can be combined in triplet or even quadruplet regimens, have provided clinicians with several new therapeutic options for relapsed and refractory MM (RRMM) patients. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis), which influence transcriptional activation and other nuclear events by increasing histone acetylation, have been developed in recent years as a treatment for RRMM1,5\u20137. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) are overexpressed in MM, leading to reduced expression of tumor suppressor genes and, consequently, increased growth and proliferation of tumor cells. Unsurprisingly, overexpression of class I HDACs is associated with a poorer prognosis in MM8.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597055.8289187}
