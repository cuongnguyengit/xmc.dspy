ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: It is debated whether patients with IgAN with heavy proteinuria and decreased eGFR benefit from aggressive treatment consisting of corticosteroids alone or combined with immunosuppressive agents. A retrospective study was performed between January 2008 and December 2016 on patients with IgAN who had urinary protein excretion > 1.0 g/d and an eGFR between 15 and 59 mL/min/1.73 m2. These patients were assigned to receive supportive care alone or supportive care plus immunosuppressive therapy. The primary outcome was defined as the first occurrence of a 50% decrease in eGFR or the development of ESKD. All 208 included patients were followed for a median of 43 months, and 92 (44%) patients experienced the primary outcome. Cumulative kidney survival was better in the immunosuppression group than in the supportive care group (p < .001). The median annual rate of eGFR decline in the immunosuppression group was -2.0 (-7.3 to 4.2), compared with -8.4 (-18.9 to -4.1) mL/min/1.73 m2 in the supportive care group (p < .001). In multivariate Cox regression analyses, immunosuppressive therapy was associated with a lower risk of progression to ESKD, independent of age, sex, eGFR, proteinuria, MAP, kidney histologic findings and the use of RASi agents (HR = 0.335; 95% CI 0.209-0.601). Among the adverse events, infection requiring hospitalization occurred at similar rates in both groups (p = .471). Immunosuppressive therapy attenuated the rate of eGFR decline and was associated with a favorable kidney outcome in IgAN patients with heavy proteinuria and decreased eGFR, and the side effects were tolerable. TEXT: Introduction IgAN is recognized as the world\u2019s most common primary glomerular disease with variable clinical presentation and progression rates that are dependent on the clinicopathological phenotype and duration of follow-up. Overall 4\u201340% of patients progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) by 10 years [1]. For patients with IgAN at risk of progressive disease (those with proteinuria above 1.0 g/d, hypertension, or decreased eGFR [2,3], a number of supportive measures are recommended as a general approach for these patients, such as strict blood pressure (BP) control and the use of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi) agents [4]. These supportive measures are relatively safe but invariably not sufficient to prevent the progression of ESKD [5]. When the serum creatinine exceeds 3 mg/dL, 80% of patients do not receive RASi agents because of the associated adverse events [6]. Therefore, the selection of only those who would benefit from additional conservative management to strike the optimal balance between risk and benefit remains a challenge to the clinician, especially among patients with heavy proteinuria and decreased eGFR.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597132.7947357}
