ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Calciphylaxis is a rare life-threatening condition that is characterized by calcification of small blood vessels and soft tissues. This condition is classically described in uraemic patients with end-stage renal failure who are on dialysis or had previous renal transplant. It has also been reported in non-uraemic patients and those who are on warfarin therapy. It is typically associated with high calcium/phosphorus product. Patients classically present with painful skin lesion that evolve into painful ulcers. There are multiple risk factors that were reported to trigger or worsen calciphylaxis. Treatment is a multidisciplinary approach that involves elimination of risk factors, wound management, pain control, and optimization of calcium/phosphorus metabolism. Reported mortality rates are very high especially in the uraemic group. Here we present a case of a patient, who is on chronic renal dialysis for stage renal failure, who underwent mechanical mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve repair. In the perioperative period, she was exposed to multiple risk factors that are known to potentially trigger prophylaxis. In the early postoperative period, she developed new-onset rapidly deteriorating skin lesions and the histopathological diagnosis confirmed calciphylaxis. Her treatment plan included pain control, frequent wound care, and optimization of nutritional and metabolic status. Calciphylaxis is a very serious condition that is usually associated with poor outcome. In this case, we discuss the unusual presentation of this condition with particular emphasis on the multiple perioperative risk factors that can potentially trigger the onset of calciphylaxis in postoperative cardiac patients. We also discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, histopathological findings, and different lines of treatment of this serious condition and the potential preventative strategies. TEXT: Learning points Calciphylaxis is a life-threatening condition that mainly affects patients with chronic end-stage renal disease, and it has poor prognosis. Multiple risk factors can trigger or worsen prophylaxis in this group of patients. During the perioperative period of cardiac surgery, these patients may be exposed to many of these risk factors which can potentially trigger calciphylaxis. Perioperative elimination of these risk factors and optimization of patients\u2019 metabolic and nutritional status can potentially prevent the occurrence of this dire condition. Introduction Calciphylaxis, also known as calcific uraemic arteriopathy,1 is a rare condition that is characterized by calcification and subsequent thrombosis of the micro-vessels of the subcutaneous fatty tissue and dermis.1 This results in the development of a wide spectrum of ischaemic skin lesions (ranging from erythema and tenderness to necrotic ulcers) which are characteristically very painful.2\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597049.5418813}
