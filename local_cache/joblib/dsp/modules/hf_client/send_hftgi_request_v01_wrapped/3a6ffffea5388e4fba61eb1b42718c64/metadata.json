ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Studies about the incidence and severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children are still significantly lower than those in adults. Moreover, data on the effect of COVID-19 in children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are limited. To the best of our knowledge, this study first reported mortality in a child with CHD who acquired COVID-19. A 16-month-old boy presented to the emergency department due to shortness of breath, fever, cough, and poor oral intake. He tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). He required mechanical ventilation for rapidly progressing respiratory failure. The patient had a large mid-muscular ventricular septal defect (VSD) that was closed percutaneously at the age of 13 months. Moreover, we followed his hospital sequelae from admission to death. This child had multiple risk factors, including malnutrition and persistent pulmonary hypertension (PH) after late closure of the VSD. The pre-existing PH could have been aggravated by the lung condition associated with COVID-19 and the respiratory failure triggered by SARS-CoV-2 infection. The patient presented with ventricular systolic dysfunction, elevated troponin serum levels and newly developed trifascicular block, which were indicative of myocardial injury. The elevated inflammatory markers and multi-organ dysfunction seem to corroborate multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, which was described recently among paediatric patients with COVID-19. TEXT: Learning points Persistent pulmonary hypertension after late ventricular septal defect closure and malnutrition could be risk factors for critical illness in children with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Myocardial injury can be observed in paediatric patients with coronavirus disease 2019. Introduction The world has been experiencing the greatest healthcare challenge since December 2019 when coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first detected in Wuhan, China.1 The first confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a child was reported in Shenzhen on 20 January 2020.2 Thereafter, several paediatric case reports and case series have been published. The SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in children is significantly lower than that in adults. Data from China and the USA showed that only about 2% of all reported COVID-19 cases involved individuals aged below 18 years.3,4 Data on children with congenital heart disease (CHD) who acquire COVID-19 are limited. Moreover, comorbidities are associated with severe illness in children.5 Timeline Time Events 3 February 2020 Percutaneous ventricular septal defect closure 25 March 2020 Hospital admission due to bronchiolitis 29 March 2020 Discharged home 13 May 2020 The patient had shortness of breath, fever, cough, vomiting, and poor oral intake 15 May 2020\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597173.5303648}
