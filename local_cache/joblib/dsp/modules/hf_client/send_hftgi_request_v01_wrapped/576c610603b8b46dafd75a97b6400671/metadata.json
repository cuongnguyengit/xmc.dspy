ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: A 32-year-old woman with schizophrenia and persistent auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs), which caused continuous suicidal thoughts and depression, was treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) of an acute course followed by maintenance ECT (M-ECT) augmented onto clozapine for 7 years. Although the general psychopathology and AVHs initially reduced slightly with ECT and clozapine, her AVHs and suicidal thoughts did not decrease subjectively. When 3 years of M-ECT, her voices declined sharply, and improvement was maintained for 2 years thereafter. A total 91 ECT sessions were performed. The daily clozapine dose was decreased from 325 to 200 mg and plasma levels remained higher than 350 ng/ml; there were no noticeable cognitive side effects. In summary, we report a case showing a sudden sharp reduction in persistent AVHs after 3 years of long-term M-ECT. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are the most common symptom of schizophrenia, occurring in 60\u221280% of patients [1 -3]. Although clozapine is highly effective in reducing AVHs and can be used on a long-term basis, more than 25% of patients treated with clozapine continue to suffer from AVHs [2,4 -7]. Persistent AVHs are associated with an increased risk of suicide, violence, and hospitalization [8 -10]. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) augmentation onto clozapine has been reported to be particularly effective for refractory schizophrenia [11 -14]. However, the ECT effect on hallucinations per se has never been demonstrated, rendering its efficacy low [7,15,16]. Nonetheless, there is no evidence that the therapeutic effect of ECT diminishes over time; rather, it appears to get stronger with continuing treatment [17,18]. Additionally, there is no evidence of persistent cognitive side effects associated with maintenance ECT (M-ECT) [14,19,20], and several studies have actually shown improved cognition over time [13]. Well-designed studies of the long-term M-ECT effects on persistent AVHs in patients with schizophrenia in terms of symptom resolution, persistence of any improvement, and relapse prevention are very limited [13,17,21]. Therefore, even case reports of very long-term ECT treatment could contribute to our understanding of the M-ECT effects on persistent AVHs [17]. We present the case of a female patient with schizophrenia who suffered from persistent AVHs associated with suicidal thoughts and depression despite long-term clozapine treatment. During 7 years of ECT and clozapine, persistent AVHs were eventually resolved and stabilized without significant cognitive side effects. This case report has been exempted from review by the Institutional Review Board, and written consent was provided by the patient.
