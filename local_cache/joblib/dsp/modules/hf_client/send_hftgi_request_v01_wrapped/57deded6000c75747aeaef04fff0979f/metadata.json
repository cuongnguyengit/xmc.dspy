ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \"found down\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \u201ccatch up\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient. We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Compartment syndrome, crush syndrome, sleep deprivation, zolpidem, diphenhydramine\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Multiple Fixed Drug Eruption Mimicking Parapsoriasis en Plaque in a Patient with Hepatitis C Virus Infection. ABSTRACT: Although hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is often associated with extrahepatic cutaneous manifestations such as lichen planus, it is unclear whether HCV per se or HCV-specific immune responses play a pathophysiological role in the development of HCV-related cutaneous diseases. We recently treated a patient who developed parapsoriasis en plaque-like lesions after ingestion of various drugs. She showed hypersensitivity to multiple drugs after interferon therapy. Her clinical course was complicated by flares of parapsoriasis-like lesions which returned at precisely the same sites. The flares had begun within hours of ingesting nicardipine hydrochloride, amlodipine besilate, candesartan cilexetil and atenolol for the first time despite showing a low level of HCV RNA. Interestingly, the flares gradually subsided during continued treatment with these drugs while her HCV RNA level paradoxically increased: thus, there was an inverse correlation between flares and HCV RNA level. The eruptions were eventually diagnosed as fixed drug eruption, although the clinical manifestations mimicked parapsoriasis en plaque. Our results suggest that multiple drug hypersensitivity could be induced by antiviral immune responses that are cross-reactive to multiple drugs, but not by HCV per se. TEXT: Introduction Although it has been reported that hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be pathogenic for several skin diseases [1, 2, 3], it is unclear whether HCV per se or hepatitis treatment agents cause these diseases. Although recently developed interferon (IFN)-free therapies for HCV shorten the treatment duration and alleviate sustained virologic responses [4], pegylated IFN (PEG-IFN) concomitant with ribavirin is used in patients with HCV genotype 1b [5, 6], and, as IFN is known to affect the cytokine cascade [7, 8], adverse effects of treatment with IFN plus ribavirin are attributed to IFN. Accordingly, since IFN can stimulate macrophages to produce IL-15, which activate anti-viral CD8 and natural killer cell responses [9], we hypothesized that adverse events in patients treated with these agents were IFN-induced immune responses not effects of HCV per se. If adverse events in HCV-infected patients were sustained HCV-specific immune responses, development or exacerbation of such events should be temporarily associated with decreased HCV viral load. We report serial measures of HCV viral load and incidence of comorbid dermal lesions in a patient with chronic HCV infection.
