ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Ustekinumab, an IL-12/23 inhibitor, is an important agent in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. Clinical trials have not demonstrated significantly increased infection risk with ustekinumab. We report a case of disseminated histoplasmosis in the setting of ustekinumab and methotrexate following a hike in the Catskill Mountains, a region not commonly associated with Histoplasma encapsulatum. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of newly acquired histoplasmosis complicating treatment with ustekinumab. TEXT: 1 Introduction Since 1998, biological agents have become a critical part of the management of inflammatory bowel disease because of their remarkable efficacy [1,2]. As immunomodulators, however, these medications can potentiate serious immunologic reactions, infections, and malignancies. The TNF-\u03b1 antagonists, for example, clearly increase the risk for serious infection and a recent meta-analysis suggests that this risk is higher when these agents are used in combination with more traditional agents, such as thiopurines or methotrexate [3]. By comparison, while the FDA label indicates that ustekinumab \u201cmay increase the risk of infections or reactivation of latent infections,\u201d several large randomized trials and long term follow-up studies of patients receiving ustekinumab have not demonstrated an increased risk of infection [[4], [5], [6], [7], 8, [9]]. Unlike the TNF-\u03b1 antagonists, there is no boxed warning for the development of histoplasmosis. We report herein the first case to our knowledge of newly acquired disseminated histoplasmosis in a young man with ulcerative colitis and atopic dermatitis who was receiving ustekinumab and methotrexate. The case carries valuable implications for diagnosis and treatment of histoplasmosis in patients who are receiving ustekinumab. 2 Case 2.1 Presentation A 35-year-old man presented in June with fever, drenching night sweats, weight loss, headache, and dyspnea while receiving ustekinumab for ulcerative colitis and methotrexate for atopic dermatitis [Day 0 = symptom onset]. He had been first diagnosed with ulcerative colitis ten years earlier and had failed multiple lines of treatment including mesalamine, 6-mercaptopurine, balsalazide, vedolizumab, and infliximab. Ustekinumab had been started two years prior with complete remission of disease. All remaining agents were discontinued in the following four months, and he continued on single agent therapy with ustekinumab thereafter. One year prior, he had been diagnosed with atopic dermatitis for which he received cyclosporine, which was cross tapered to methotrexate in the month prior to presentation.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597095.6221998}
