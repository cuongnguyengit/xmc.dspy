ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: COVID-19 Outcomes Among Users of CD20 Inhibitors for Immune-Mediated Diseases: A Comparative Cohort Study. ABSTRACT: Patients with immune-mediated diseases treated with CD20 inhibitors may have worse COVID-19 outcomes due to impaired humoral immunity, but differences versus the general population are unknown. We identified patients with immune-mediated diseases who received CD20 inhibitors within one year prior to the index date of PCR-confirmed COVID-19 between January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2021. Comparators with COVID-19 were matched up to 5:1 by age, sex, and PCR date. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death in CD20 inhibitor users versus comparators were estimated using Cox regression. We identified 114 cases with COVID-19 who had received CD20 inhibitors for immune-mediated diseases (mean age 55 years, 70% female) and 559 matched comparators with COVID-19 (mean age 54 years, 70% female). CD20 inhibitor-treated cases had higher mortality (aHR 2.16; 95% CI: 1.03 to 4.54) than matched comparators. Risks of hospitalization (aHR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.26) and mechanical ventilation (aHR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.36 to 1.87) were similar. Similar trends were seen in analyses according to type of indication (e.g., rheumatic or neurologic disease) and duration of CD20 inhibitor use (<1 or \u22651 year), and after excluding patients with interstitial lung disease, cancer, and those on glucocorticoids prior to COVID-19 diagnosis. Patients who received CD20 inhibitors for immune-mediated diseases prior to COVID-19 had higher mortality following COVID-19 than matched comparators, highlighting the urgent need to mitigate excess risks in CD20 inhibitor users during the ongoing pandemic. What is already known about this subject?: Patients with immune-mediated diseases treated with CD20 inhibitors may have worse COVID-19 outcomes than those treated with other immunomodulatory medications, but differences compared to the general population are unknown.What does this study add?: CD20 inhibitor-treated cases had over two-fold higher risk of mortality than matched general population comparators, although risks of hospitalization and mechanical ventilation were similar.How might this impact on clinical practice or future developments?: There is an urgent need for risk mitigation strategies, such as SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies or booster vaccinations, for patients with immune-mediated diseases treated with CD20 inhibitors during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
