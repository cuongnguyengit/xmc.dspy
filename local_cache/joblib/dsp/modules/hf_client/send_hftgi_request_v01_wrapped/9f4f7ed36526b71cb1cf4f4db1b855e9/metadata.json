ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED), caused by mutations in the AIRE gene, is mainly characterized by the triad of hypoparathyroidism, primary adrenocortical insufficiency and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, but can include many other manifestations, with no currently clear genotype-phenotype correlation. We present the clinical features of two siblings, a male and a female, with the same mutations in the AIRE gene associated with two very different phenotypes. Interestingly, the brother recently experienced COVID-19 infection with pneumonia, complicated by hypertension, hypokalemia and hypercalcemia. Although APECED is a monogenic disease, its expressiveness can be extremely different. In addition to the genetic basis, epigenetic and environmental factors might influence the phenotypic expression, although their exact role remains to be elucidated. TEXT: 1. Background Autoimmune polyendocrinopathy\u2013candidiasis\u2013ectodermal dystrophy (APECED) is a rare monogenic disease, caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene on chromosome 21 (21q22.3). APECED is mainly known for the triad of hypoparathyroidism, primary adrenocortical insufficiency and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. The definite diagnosis of APECED requires one of the following three criteria: the presence of at least two out the three major clinical features or only one of the major components if a sibling has definite APECED or a disease-causing mutation in both alleles of the AIRE gene. [1]. However, many other manifestations have been described, including other endocrinopathy (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, type 1 diabetes, autoimmune thyroid diseases, pituitary defects), gastrointestinal manifestations (autoimmune gastritis, autoimmune hepatitis, intestinal malabsorption, celiac disease), ectodermal abnormalities (keratitis, enamel dysplasia, vitiligo, alopecia, nail dystrophy) and others [1,2]. The major mutation found in Finns, i.e., the c.769C>T variant, and the 13 bp deletion in exon 8 (c.967\u2013979del13), are the most common ones worldwide [1]. Currently, more than 100 pathogenic mutations have been described and recently new genetic variations have been added [3,4,5]. The AIRE gene plays an essential role in central tolerance. Mutations in the AIRE gene prevent the elimination of self-reactive T cells at the central level and induce a T regulatory cell (Treg) defect at peripheral levels, leading to the development of multiple autoimmune diseases at a young age [6,7].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597070.213408}
