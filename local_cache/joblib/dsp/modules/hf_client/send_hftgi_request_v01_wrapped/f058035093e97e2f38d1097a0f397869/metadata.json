ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Invasive sinus aspergillosis with mycotic aneurysm of the vertebral artery and subarachnoid hemorrhage - Case report. ABSTRACT: Invasive sinus aspergillosis is a rare life-threatening condition usually found in immunocompromised patients. The fungus spreads from paranasal sinuses into the central nervous system by direct extension or through blood vessels. Perineural spread is an uncommon mechanism of spread in invasive aspergillosis. A mycotic aneurysm is a dangerous complication of invasive sinus aspergillosis because of its insidious development and is often diagnosed only post-mortem after causing fatal intracranial hemorrhage. Intracranial vascular complications of invasive sinus aspergillosis require prompt recognition and treatment and should always be considered when a diagnosis of CNS aspergillosis is made. We present a case of invasive sinus aspergillosis in an apparently immunocompetent patient that manifested with a brain abscess, perineural spread of the infection, and mycotic aneurysm of the vertebral artery with subsequent rupture and fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage. This case highlights the possibility of perineural spread and hemorrhagic complications in invasive cerebral aspergillosis. TEXT: Introduction Aspergillus species are among the most common causes of fungal sinusitis around the world [1]. Fungal sinusitis presents with various clinical syndromes, ranging from benign sinonasal colonization to life-threatening invasive intracranial disease. Invasive forms of the disease with intracranial spread usually occur in immunocompromised patients, although case reports of cerebral aspergillosis in immunocompetent individuals exist [1]. Intracranial sinus aspergillosis complications include brain abscess, meningitis, vasculitis, and mycotic aneurysm [2]. Perineural spread of aspergillosis is sporadic, with not many reports in the literature. Case presentation A 66-year-old man presented to the neurology emergency unit with a 1-month history of progressive gait instability, cognitive decline, and double vision, accompanied by weight loss for one year. He also had a 1-year history of symptoms of left-sided trigeminal neuralgia. His past medical history included insomnia and episodes of diarrhea with melena of unknown etiology. Neurological examination on admission revealed moderate cognitive impairment (MMSE score was 18 out of 30 points), slightly constricted left pupil, double vision in all directions of gaze, fasciculations in the lower half of the face, and irregular rest tremor in all 4 limbs. Initial laboratory tests showed minimal elevation of C-reactive protein and leukocytosis with relative lymphopenia (relative lymphocyte count 17%). Serologic tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Treponema pallidum, and Borrelia burgdorferi were negative.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597089.379239}
