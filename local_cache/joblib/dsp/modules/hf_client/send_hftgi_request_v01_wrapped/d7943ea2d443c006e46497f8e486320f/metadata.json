ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an interstitial pneumonia caused by an immunological reaction to the chronic inhalation of an antigen. Little is known, however, about the pathological change of the pulmonary lesions. A 33-year-old man was diagnosed with chronic bird-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis based on the findings of a surgical lung biopsy and an inhalation provocation test. He underwent lung transplantation at 8 years after the diagnosis because of disease progression. We conclude that the analysis of the explant suggests that the presence of extensive fibrosis in the centrilobular and perilobular area with bridging fibrosis is a form of pathological progression of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. TEXT: Introduction Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an interstitial pneumonia caused by an immunological reaction to an inhaled antigen. Clinically, HP is divided into acute and chronic forms. In chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP), the fibrotic process progresses for more than 6 months (1). The precise diagnosis of CHP is always difficult because radiologic data and other clinical findings mimic the clinical picture of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) (2, 3). Pathological findings from surgical lung biopsy (SLB) and autopsy are therefore important for exploring the diagnosis. In the pathological observation of SLB, chronic bronchiolitis with granulomatous inflammation and bronchiolocentric distribution, in addition to perilobular fibrosis, is suggestive of CHP rather than IIPs (4). Autopsy findings also shed light on the progression of fibrosis caused by CHP (5, 6). Although the autopsy lung findings reveal the progression of CHP, the effects of terminal events, such as bacterial and fungal infection or diffuse alveolar damage are superimposed on those specimens. We hereby describe a case of CHP that was treated with lung transplantation. The specimens obtained from the explanted lung revealed how the pathological changes progressed over an 8-year period.
