ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Cardiac angiosarcoma is a rare malignancy with an aggressive course and poor prognosis. We present a 26-year old man who came to our clinic with shortness of breath and was diagnosed with a right-sided atrial mass. He underwent urgent resection of the mass. The pathology confirmed the mass to be cardiac angiosarcoma with positive microscopic margins (R1 resection). Since reresection was not feasible, the patient started treatment with concurrent paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 weekly) and proton beam therapy (61 Cobalt equivalent delivered over five weeks). After completing the concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy, he was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy using gemcitabine (900 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8) and docetaxel (100 mg/m2 on Day 8) every three weeks. After three cycles, the patient developed severe dermatitis, and hence further chemotherapy was withheld. The patient is alive at 26 months since receiving his surgery and 18 months since the completion of treatment. Patients with cardiac angiosarcoma who undergo R1 resection have a median survival of six months. More radical approaches such as orthotopic heart-lung transplant or prolonged durations of chemotherapy lead to minimal improvement in survival at the cost of increased morbidity. Here, we describe a novel approach to a rare disease that resulted in prolonged survival and led to a better quality of life without any long-term morbidity to the patient. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Cardiac angiosarcoma (CAS) is an extremely rare tumor for which optimal management is unclear. Although surgical resection remains the mainstay of treatment, multimodality treatment, including chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT), is often used to treat this aggressive malignancy. However, the median survival remains low for patients with positive microscopic margins (R1 resection) after surgical resection of the tumor. In this report, we present a novel approach of combining proton beam therapy (PBT) with chemotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, which was used to treat our patient with right\u2010sided CAS who underwent R1 resection.
