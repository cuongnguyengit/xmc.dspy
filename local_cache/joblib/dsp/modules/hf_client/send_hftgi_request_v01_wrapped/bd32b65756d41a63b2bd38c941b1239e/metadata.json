ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) is associated with malignancies, such as small-cell lung cancer. However, patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) rarely develop PNS. We herein report a 72-year-old man with NSCLC who developed disturbance of consciousness on the day of initiation of treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. Blood test results revealed anti-amphiphysin (AMPH) antibody positively, leading to the diagnosis of PNS. The disturbance of consciousness was improved with intravenous administration of steroid and immunoglobulin. To our knowledge, this is the first report of anti-AMPH antibody-positive PNS in a patient with NSCLC. TEXT: pmc1 Introduction Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) is caused by an autoimmune process that develops in patients with any types of malignancies [1,2]. Recently, several reports have shown that PNS can be induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) [[3], [4], [5]]. Amphiphysin (AMPH), one of the tumor cell antigens that induces PNS, is enriched in nerve terminals and plays a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis [6,7]. Although anti-AMPH antibody-positive PNS is common in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and breast cancer [8], it is rare in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To our knowledge, this is the first report of anti-AMPH antibody-positive PNS occurred in a patient with NSCLC treated with ICI. The clinical course of the present case suggests that anti-AMPH antibody-positive PNS may develop in patients with NSCLC and may be induced by ICI treatment. 2 Case report\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597019.002519}
