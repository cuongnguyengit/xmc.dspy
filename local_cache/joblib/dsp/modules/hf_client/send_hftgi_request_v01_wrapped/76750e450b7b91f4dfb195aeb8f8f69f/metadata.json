ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \"found down\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \u201ccatch up\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient. We will first extract the text from the article, then we will look for the drug names mentioned in the text, and finally we will check for any adverse reactions associated with those drugs.\\nReactions: compartment syndrome, crush syndrome, sleep disruption, fatigue, poor performance, patient harm, sleep deprivation, vigilance, cognition, memory, fine motor skills, cognitive performance decline, alcohol intoxication, blood alcohol concentration, pressure increase, closed fascial space, reduced capillary perfusion, long bone fracture, muscle necrosis, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, death\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Gastric perforation related to concurrent use of nintedanib and ramucirumab. ABSTRACT: The prevalence of lung cancer in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients ranges from 9.8 to 38%. Nintedanib, a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), has been approved for IPF after phase III INPULSIS trials in 2014. Ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody for VEGFR-2, combined with docetaxcel, has been approved for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after the phase III REVEL trail in 2014. Physicians will have more IPF patients being treated with nintedanib, who subsequently develop NSCLC, and therefore will likely be treated with ramucirumab plus docetaxel. We report the first case of 70-year-old man taking nintedanib for his IPF and treated with ramucirumab plus docetaxel as a seventh-line therapy for his pulmonary adenocarcinoma. On day 15 of his chemotherapy treatment cycle 2, after taking nintedanib for nine days, he developed gastric perforation. TEXT: Introduction Nintedanib, a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of platelet\u2010derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), was approved as a treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in 2014. Ramucirumab, a monoclonal antibody against VEGFR\u20102, combined with docetaxcel, has also been recently approved as a second\u2010line chemotherapy for advanced non\u2010small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The prevalence of lung cancer in IPF patients is reported to range from 9.8 to 38% 1. The number of patients taking nintedanib for their IPF who develop lung cancer, with the probability of being treated with ramucirumab plus docetaxel, will likely increase. We report the first case of gastric perforation related to the concurrent use of nintedanib for IPF and ramucirumab for NSCLC.
