ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Research has shown mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene SCN2A to be associated with developmental delays and infantile seizures in patients with early-onset epileptic encephalopathies (EOEEs). Here, we report the case of an infant with a de novo SCN2A mutation with EOEE who had medically refractory seizures that improved with a ketogenic diet (KD) implemented at an age less than 2 months. On the day of his birth, the infant presented with a pattern of convulsions with dozens of episodes per day. An initial video electroencephalogram revealed poor reactivity of background activity, with multiple partial episodes starting from the right temporal region, and abnormal electrical activity in the right hemisphere. The seizures previously were not controlled with successive therapy with phenobarbital, topiramate, and levetiracetam. Genetic testing revealed the presence of a mutation in the SCN2A gene (c.4425C>G, p.Asn1475Lys). The infant's seizures decreased significantly with a combination of KD and medication. The present case exemplifies the potential for personalized genomics in identifying the etiology of an illness. Furthermore, the KD appears to feasible in infants younger than 2 months and might elicit good responses to EOEE associated with SCN2A mutation. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Early-onset epileptic encephalopathies (EOEEs) present with developmental impairment and disastrous seizures starting in early infancy, for which a range of genetic mutations have been implicated. Mutations in the SCN2A gene, which encodes the \u03b12 subunit of the neuronal sodium channel, have been identified in association with a number of encephalopathy phenotypes, ranging from benign familial neonatal-infantile seizure to more severe forms of epileptic encephalopathy.1 In the present study, we describe the case of an infant with a de novo SCN2A mutation with EOEE.
