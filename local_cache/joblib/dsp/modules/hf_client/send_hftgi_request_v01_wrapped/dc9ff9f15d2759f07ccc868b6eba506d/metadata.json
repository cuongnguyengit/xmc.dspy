ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: A rare case of a patient with a high grade neuroendocrine tumor developing neutropenic sepsis after receiving PRRT combined with Capecitabine or Temozolomide: A case report. ABSTRACT: Neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare and demonstrate variable clinical behavior depending on the degree of tumor differentiation. Patients with poorly differentiated tumors (NET G3) have a poor prognosis. Systemic treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy is considered to be the treatment of choice. In patients that are refractory or intolerant to first-line therapy, experts recommend peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) in tumors that express somatostatin receptors. Recently, combinations of PRRT and chemotherapy were tested in patients with NET. Available data have reported promising tumor control rates and an excellent toxicity profile in cases where PRRT had been administered with capecitabine/temozolomide, even when administered as salvage therapy. The current study reported an exceptional case of advanced NET G3 with severe toxicity upon receiving PRRT in combination with capecitabine/temozolomide as third line therapy. The patient developed a life-threatening neutropenic fever, fungal pneumonia and necrotizing mastitis 23 days after the first cycle of therapy was administered. However, the treatment led to a significant reduction in tumor size. A total of 5 months after treatment initiation, the patient was alive and in excellent clinical condition with sustained tumor response. In summary, the current study presented a rare case of high grade NET exhibiting an almost complete response to PRRT in combination capecitabine/temozolomide, despite facing unexpected severe toxicity. TEXT: Introduction Neuroendocrine neoplasia (NEN) are a rare and heterogeneous group of tumors. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, NEN are stratified into low/moderate-[grade (G) 1/2] or high-grade (G3) neuroendocrine tumors (NET) and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) (1). Well-differentiated NET (G1 and G2) are characterized by a low proliferative index, retain the expression of somatostatin receptors (SSTR) and are associated with a good prognosis compared with that in other malignancies. By contrast, G3 NET feature a high Ki-67 proliferation index of >20% and are associated with a poor prognosis.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597069.9594893}
