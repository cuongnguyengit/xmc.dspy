ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) is first line for treatment of people with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH). Emerging data suggest the possibility of adverse metabolic effects of these medications. We describe 3 cases in which PWH developed hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis within months of being switched to bictegravir-based ART. TEXT: People with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH) have increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), regardless of exposure to antiretroviral therapy (ART) [1]. Although early ART regimens were associated with dyslipidemia and other metabolic derangements, contemporary ART, including the integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) class, are thought to have a better safety profile. Recent data has suggested that INSTI use may be associated with weight gain and the development of insulin-resistant diabetes [2, 3] and, in rarer cases, accelerated hyperglycemia [4\u20136]. Bictegravir (BIC) is a second-generation INSTI, available in coformulation with emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), and is currently recommended as a first-line ART regimen for newly diagnosed PWH [7, 8]. To our knowledge, there are no case reports of BIC-related accelerated hyperglycemia. METHODS We identified 3 PWH with new or acutely worsening hyperglycemia with ketoacidosis after initiation of BIC-based ART regimens. Patient Consent Statement The Washington University Institutional Review board evaluated this project and deemed it nonhuman subject research. Case 1 A 50-year-old Filipino male with a 25-year history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), chronic hepatitis B, and schizoaffective disorder presented off medications for 2 months. His ART was transitioned from rilpivirine (RPV)/tenofovir disoproxil fumerate (TDF)/FTC to BIC/TAF/FTC. His other medications included stable doses of sertraline, prazosin, and paliperidone palmitate; the latter he had received by intramuscular injection for the past 3 years. His HbA1c at the time of medication transition was 6.6% and he had a fasting glucose of 85 mg/dL. Approximately 3 weeks after the ART switch, he had a random glucose of 223 mg/dL. Four months after the switch, he presented to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain. He was found to have a blood glucose concentration greater than 400 mg/dL and an elevated blood ketone level of 4.5 mmol/L. His C-peptide level was 1.2 ng/mL (normal limit 1.1\u20134.4 ng/mL). Upon presentation to the hospital his HbA1c was >17%. He was discharged receiving 1.4 units of insulin/kg per day and his ART was transitioned back to RPV/TDF/FTC. Within 2 months of discharge, he had a 70% reduction in insulin requirements with well controlled blood glucose concentrations and an HbA1c of 6.5%.
