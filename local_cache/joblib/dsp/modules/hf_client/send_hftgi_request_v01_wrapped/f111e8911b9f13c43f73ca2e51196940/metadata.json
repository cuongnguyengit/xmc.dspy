ABSTRACT: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon and life-threating condition characterized by major immune activation and massive cytokine production by mononuclear inflammatory cells, due to defects in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. It is even more unusual in renal transplant recipients, in which it is often associated with uncontrolled infection. The mortality is high in HLH and differential diagnosis with sepsis is a challenge. The approach and management depend on the underlying trigger and comorbidities. We report a case of a 50-year-old renal transplant female admitted with fever and malaise 3 months post-transplant and presenting anemia, fever, hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of serum ferritin, and positive CMV antigenemia. Urine was positive for decoy cells and BKV-DNA. Graft biopsy showed CMV nephritis. Both blood and urine cultures where positive for E. coli. Hemophagocytosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone, with complete response after 3 weeks. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of a rare and serious condition in a renal transplant patient, which can allow a favorable clinical course and improve survival rate. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) consists of an immune hyperactivation syndrome that takes place when NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to eliminate activated macrophages, leading to over production of proinflammatory cytokines1. There are primary and acquired causes. Primary HLH is rare and typically manifests in childhood because of two autosomal recessive defects in genes that encode proteins involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules during apoptosis in natural killer (NK) cells.1 , 2Acquired (secondary) HLH is triggered by various conditions as infections, immunodeficiency, rheumatologic diseases, and cancer.1 , 3 , 4 Infection is the most common precipitating factor of HLH in adults, mainly viruses of herpes family (EBV, CMV, HSV, HHV8), but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens can also be a trigger.5 , 6 Multiorgan involvement and organomegaly are frequently found and hemophagocytosis results in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of HLH is based on the presence of at least 5 of the following 8 criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting \u2265 2 lineages of peripheral blood cells), hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, serum ferritin >500 ng/mL, low activity of NK cells, soluble CD25 > 2.400 U/mL and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes.7 Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red cells, platelets, or white cells in macrophage cytoplasm visualized in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.2 The syndrome is defined by a complex picture. However, some patients may have incipient or partial disease.1 Most diagnostic\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND There is a lack of information about a mixed type of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) after heart transplantation (HTx) with no amiodarone treatment in almost 1 year. Frequent ventricular extrasystoles (VES) associated with a mixed type of AIT can often be treated using thiamazole and prednisolone, without the need for specific antiarrhythmic treatment. METHODS We present a clinical case of a 65-year-old heart transplanted male patient with frequent VES associated with mixed type of AIT. Recipient had managed with amiodarone prior to HTx but there were no indications for it after the surgery. One year after antiarrhythmic treatment was discontinued, monomorphic VES (total amount: 27 472/day) were diagnosed. In addition, our investigation revealed that thyrotoxicosis developed. Prednisolone and thiamazole were added to the treatment with positive outcomes. The antithyroid treatment had been discontinued after 9 months and results of the 24-h Holter electrocardiogram monitoring showed only two VES/24 h. CONCLUSIONS The case highlights the association of amiodarone, thyroid disorders, and VES. In mixed type AIT or if diagnosis is uncertain, it is reasonable to use mixed therapy. Next is to decide whether you need special treatment for VES. There was no evidence of ventricular tachycardia. Thyroid function tests remained normal off antithyroid medications and the total amount of VES significantly decreased. There were no indications for any antiarrhythmic treatment or ablation. TEXT: Learning points In patients who have been treated with amiodarone prior to heart transplantation, should be periodically screened for thyroid disorders to promptly diagnosed delayed onset amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction. It is important to consider the mixed type of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis in borderline cases. Introduction Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction develops in 15\u201320% of patients under amiodarone therapy.1 Two main forms of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) may occur: Type 1 is a form of iodine-induced hyperthyroidism occurring in patients with underlying thyroid abnormalities, and Type 2 is a destructive thyroiditis mainly due to direct cytotoxic effects of amiodarone on thyroid follicular cells of a normal thyroid gland.2 At the same time, AIT Type 2 generally develops in patients without clinical, biochemical, and morphological evidence of thyroid disease.3 One study showed that despite discontinuation of amiodarone treatment at the time of the heart transplantation (HTx) procedure, patients remain at risk for developing mixed thyroid disease. Heart transplanted recipients treated with amiodarone before HTx should, therefore, be monitored carefully for a development of thyroid dysfunction, especially within the first post-transplant year.4 Timeline\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596474.203108}
