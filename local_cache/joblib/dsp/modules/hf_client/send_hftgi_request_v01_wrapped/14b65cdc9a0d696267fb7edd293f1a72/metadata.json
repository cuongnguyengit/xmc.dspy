ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia in children includes confirmation of hyperthyroidism, infection, inflammatory processes, and malignant tumors. Immobilization-induced hypercalcemia is rare in healthy individuals, although it can occur in adolescent males, especially after fracture. Immobility can cause increased skeletal calcium release and hypercalcemia, and this condition is also known as resorptive hypercalcemia. We present a case of a 10-year-old adolescent girl with advanced heart failure who underwent implantation with a HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device. She had symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation on the fifth month of hospitalization. She subsequently developed immobilization-induced symptomatic hypercalcemia (serum calcium, 12.1 mg/dL; corrected calcium 12.8 mg/dL; parathormone, 1.9 pg/mL; calcium/creatinine ratio in spot urine, 1.21). However, hypercalcemia is uncommon in children with advanced heart failure. Bisphosphonate therapy was initiated because our patient did not respond to hydration and furosemide treatment, and she had persistent abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. The patient&apos;s complaints were resolved on the second day after administrating bisphosphonate, and hypercalcemia did not recur. TEXT: pmcHighlights \u00b7 Immobility can be caused by increased skeletal Ca+ release and hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia caused by immobilization is rare in prolonged critical illness processes within PICU patients. \u00b7 Bisphosphonate is indicated if there is no response to hydration and loop diuretics treatments. Introduction Immobilization-induced hypercalcemia is common in individuals with rapid bone turnover, such as spinal cord injuries, fractures, or Paget's disease [1]. It occurs when osteoclastic bone resorption exceeds the rate of osteoblastic bone formation, causing an imbalance in the bone remodeling process [2]. Such hypercalcemia is either asymptomatic or has vague clinical features [3]. However, it is occasionally severe and can cause various symptoms, such as neuromuscular findings, seizures, and respiratory arrest [3]. Albright was the first to describe immobilization-induced hypercalcemia in 1941, in a 14-year-old adolescent [4]. In that case report, the patient had developed hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria after immobilization secondary to a femoral neck fracture and had undergone a series of investigations and treatments, including parathyroidectomy, before the correct diagnosis was made [3].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597043.5811057}
