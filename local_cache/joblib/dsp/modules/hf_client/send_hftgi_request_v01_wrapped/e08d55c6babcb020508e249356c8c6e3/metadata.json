ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis associated with protein S deficiency is rare in adolescent patients and has high disability and fatality.Patient concerns: A 15-year-old male student presented in the hospital with sudden headache, nausea, and vomiting and was diagnosed with protein S deficiency by gene testing. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis due to protein S deficiency was diagnosed in this adolescent patient, who underwent successful endovascular therapy (EVT). METHODS The patient was treated with standard anti-coagulation therapy including low-molecular-weight heparin (90 IU/kg/Q12 h) and dehydrant (mannitol 125 mL Q8 h); however, the symptoms were not alleviated. Successful EVT was implemented. RESULTS Both the superior sagittal sinus and bilateral transverse sinus were recanalized after thrombus clearance. The patient achieved a complete recovery without any other stroke recurrence during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS EVT can be performed with favorable and effective clinical outcomes in adolescent cerebral venous sinus thrombosis patients with protein S deficiency. EVT associated with standard anti-coagulation therapy may improve the prognosis and reduce mortality among such patients. TEXT: pmc1 Introduction Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare cerebrovascular disease. The annual incidence in adults is 1.32/100,000, and that in females 31 to 50 years of age is considerably higher (2.78/100,000).[1,2] However, the incidence among children under 18 years of age is 0.67/100,000, and most of those affected are neonates.[3] The clinical characteristics of CVST are diverse, leading difficulties and delays in diagnoses. Although guidelines generally recommend anti-coagulation therapy as the basic treatment for CVST, the outcomes of nearly 20% of adult patients are disability or death, and nearly 47% of adolescent patients have a poor prognosis after treatment.[4] With the development of endovascular therapy (EVT) for cerebral arterial diseases, EVT has become a salvage treatment for such patients. Although several single-center studies have reported good outcomes, a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled study is still necessary. Moreover, reports of adolescent patients with CVST who have undergone successful EVT are even rarer. Here, the case of a comatose adolescent patient with CVST who was successfully treated by EVT is described. 2 Case report\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597093.5770633}
