ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: The EBMT Chronic Malignancies Working Party performed a retrospective analysis of 215 patients who underwent a second allo-HCT for myeloma between 1994 and 2017, 159 for relapse and 56 for graft failure. In the relapse group, overall survival (OS) was 38% (30-46%) at 2 years and 25% (17-32%) at 5 years. Patients who had a HLA-identical sibling (HLAid-Sib) donor for their first and second transplants had superior OS (5 year OS: HLAid-Sib/HLAid-Sib: 35% (24-46%); Others 9% (0-17%), p < 0.001). There was a significantly higher incidence of acute grade II-IV GvHD in those patients who had also developed GvHD following their initial HLA-identical sibling allo-HCT (HLAid-Sib/HLAid-Sib: 50% (33-67%); Other 22% (8-36%), p = 0.03). More as opposed to fewer than 2 years between transplants was associated with superior 5-yr OS (31% (21-40%) vs. 10% (1-20%), P = 0.005). On multivariate analysis, consecutive HLA-identical sibling donor transplants conferred a significant OS advantage (0.4 (0.24-0.67), p < 0.001). In the graft failure group, OS was 41% at 2 years. In summary, a second allo-HCT using a HLA-identical sibling donor, if available, provides the best transplant outcomes for relapsed myeloma in this setting. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Although allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) is not routinely performed in patients with multiple myeloma (MM), this approach is still offered to patients with high-risk disease. According to the EBMT database, there were 2684 MM patients transplanted in EBMT centres between 2013 and 2018. Post-transplant relapse remains the main cause of treatment failure. Options for the treatment of disease relapse following allo-HCT include salvage chemotherapy, novel targeted agents, and, increasingly, immunotherapies [1\u20134]. In selected patients who achieve clinical remission, there may be a role for a second allo-HCT [5\u201310]. The first reports of outcomes following second allogeneic transplants to treat disease relapse were characterised by prohibitively high rates of non-relapse mortality (NRM) of up to 45% [11, 12]. Less toxicity was seen with the use of reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens. Shaw and colleagues performed a retrospective U.K. multi-centre analysis of 71 patients receiving a second allogeneic transplant using RIC after disease relapse following an initial myeloablative allo-HCT [5]. The predicted overall survival (OS) and NRM at 2 years were 28% and 27%, respectively. In a subsequent EBMT registry study of 234 adult patients with acute leukaemia who received a second RIC transplant between 2000 and 2012 as salvage treatment for relapse following an initial RIC allo-HCT, the cumulative NRM and OS rates at 2 years were 22.4%, and 20.5%, respectively [6].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597054.0530114}
