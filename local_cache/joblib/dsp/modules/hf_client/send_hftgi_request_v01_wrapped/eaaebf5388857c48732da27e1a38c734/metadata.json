ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: A 72-year-old man daily suffered from a refractory angina consecutive to a diffuse coronary artery disease despite optimal medical management. Revascularization could not be performed because of a severe thrombopenia. He was referred to our outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programme where he was candidate for 20 sessions, three times a week, of high-intensity aerobic interval training involving brief episodes of regressive myocardial ischaemia. After 7 weeks, exercise capacity (+28.5%), VO2 peak (35.7%), and ischaemic threshold increased while clinical status and quality of life improved. No adverse effect was reported. Aerobic interval training with myocardial ischaemia might be a therapeutic alternative in refractory angina. TEXT: Introduction Many patients suffer from refractory angina consecutive to coronary artery disease (CAD) with no possibility of revascularization despite anti\u2010ischaemic medical therapy. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) by improving endothelial dysfunction and increasing the growth of collateral coronary arteries 1 appears as one therapeutic option. 2 However, while we know the benefits of exercise\u2010induced claudication in peripheral artery disease 3 and the occurrence of myocardial endogenous cardioprotective mechanisms after brief intermittent ischaemic episodes, 4 traditional training exercise do respect the \u2018sacrosanct dogma\u2019 of the threshold for myocardial ischaemia and must be prescribed at a target heart rate remaining 10 b.p.m. below the ischaemic threshold. 2 With the objective to attenuate symptoms, we designed a new CR protocol with aerobic interval training (AIT) including intermittent myocardial ischaemia. Case report A 72\u2010year\u2010old patient presented a stable CAD with disabling refractory angina for 2 months (Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III angina) despite medical therapy including Aspirin, Atorvastatin, Bisoprolol of 5 mg, Amlodipine of 5 mg, Nicorandil of 20 mg bid, and Trimetazidine of 35 mg bid. Nitrates were not tolerated. The left ventricular ejection fraction was normal. Coronary angiography, performed after a positive exercise test, has shown a diffuse calcified multivessel CAD with distal lesions unsuitable for coronary artery bypass graft (Figure 1 A\u2013D ). Coronary angioplasty could technically be performed. However, considering a severe thrombopenia of 30 000/mm3 consecutive to chronic lymphoid leukaemia, dual antiplatelet therapy was temporarily contraindicated.
