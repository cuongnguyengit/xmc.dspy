ABSTRACT: Conventional skeletal chondrosarcoma is a bone neoplasm, which is poorly sensitive to anthracyclines-based chemotherapy. We report on an 18-month-long tumour response to gemcitabine as single agent in a young patient with an advanced secondary peripheral conventional chondrosarcoma, previously treated unsuccessfully with anthracyclines, ifosfamide, platinum, etoposide. TEXT: Background The skeletal chondrosarcoma family represents a heterogeneous group of malignant bone mesenchymal tumours characterised by the production of a chondroid matrix. They are the third bone sarcoma in incidence, and the most frequent in adults. There are three main subtypes: conventional, mesenchymal, and clear-cell. A \u201cdedifferentiated\u201d chondrosarcoma develops in 10-15% of conventional chondrosarcomas, while mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a high-grade, aggressive neoplasm with a natural history and chemosensitivity that might be close to Ewing sarcoma, and clear-cell chondrosarcoma is a low-grade variant [1]. In conventional chondrosarcoma (cCS), the histological malignancy grade is the main prognostic factor [2]. Grade 1 cCS are characterised by a very low metastatic potential, and some authors have quite recently suggested a re-classification of these types as \u201catypical cartilaginous tumours\u201d [1]. Grade 2 and 3 cCS are marked by a higher metastatic potential, with a 10-year survival of 64-86% and 29-55% respectively [3,4]. CCSs are also categorised according to their location in the bone: a central chondrosarcoma onsets in the medullary cavity, a small percentage of them from a pre-existing benign lesion known as enchondroma, while a peripheral variant arises from the surface of the bone, as a result of malignant progression of a pre-existing benign (solitary or hereditary) osteochondroma. Surgery is the mainstay of the treatment of localized disease. While curettage is acceptable for grade 1 cCS, wide excision is usually required for higher grade cCS, with the exception of skull base cCS which may be treated with radiotherapy. In particular, hadrons can play an important role in the management of skull base cCS, and very good outcomes are reported [5].\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \"found down\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \u201ccatch up\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND TAFRO syndrome, which was first reported in 2010 in Japan, is a relatively rare disease characterized by thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, renal impairment, reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly. Although this disease is considered similar to multicentric Castleman disease, some of the clinical features, such as thrombocytopenia, are different from typical cases of multicentric Castleman disease. In addition, the etiology of TAFRO syndrome remains unknown and controversial. There have only been a few cases of TAFRO syndrome complicated with adrenal gland lesions, and all of them have had hemorrhagic involvement. METHODS This report describes the case of a 46-year-old Asian man who presented with fever, epigastric pain, and back pain for 1 month. A computed tomographic scan revealed ascites, mild lymphadenopathy, and left adrenal necrosis without hemorrhage. A blood test showed thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine levels. Based on the edema, severe thrombocytopenia, fever, reticulin myelofibrosis shown by bone marrow biopsy, mild lymphadenopathy, and progressive renal insufficiency, we diagnosed this patient as having TAFRO syndrome. He was successfully treated by immediate administration of glucocorticoids and tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS There have been no previous reports of a case of TAFRO syndrome complicated with adrenal necrosis. Because the biopsy of the left adrenal gland revealed necrosis without any evidence of hemorrhage, we concluded that the unilateral adrenal necrosis in this case was caused by either ischemia from infarction or organomegaly itself under severe hypercytokinemia. This unusual clinical course is useful for further analysis of the etiology of TAFRO syndrome. TEXT: Background TAFRO syndrome (thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, renal impairment or reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly) was first reported by Takai et al. in 2010 [1], and several cases have since been reported, mainly in Japan, but also in other countries. At first, TAFRO syndrome was thought to be a subtype of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)-negative idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD), but Iwaki et al. recently reported that the pathophysiology of TAFRO syndrome seemed to differ from that of iMCD [2]. Along with increasing case reports, the diagnosis criteria and treatment guidelines, as well as the concept of this disease, have been established gradually [2, 3]. In terms of organ damage, the kidneys are commonly involved, and temporal hemodialysis is required in some cases [2]. Notably, there have only been a few cases of TAFRO syndrome complicated with adrenal lesions, and all of them have had hemorrhagic involvement [4, 5]. No cases accompanied by adrenal gland necrosis without hemorrhage have yet been reported.\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to', 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596253.8876455}
