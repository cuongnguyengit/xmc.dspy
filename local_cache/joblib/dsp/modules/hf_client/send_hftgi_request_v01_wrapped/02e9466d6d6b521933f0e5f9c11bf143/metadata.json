ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in idiopathic inflammatory myositis (IIM) with India being endemic for Tuberculosis (TB). We compared and contrasted the prevalence, clinical profile and outcomes of active TB in IIM with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Medical records were reviewed for adults and children with IIM (Bohan and Peter criteria) and SLE (ACR criteria) at a tertiary care hospital in India from January 2015 to October 2017. Follow-up was recorded until February 2020 for all those who had developed active TB. Of 167 (132 adults and 35 juvenile) IIM and 280 (131 adults and 149 juvenile) SLE, active TB occurred in 24 (14.4%) IIM (22 (16.7% of 132) adults; 2 (5.71% of 35) juvenile) and 18 (6.4%) SLE [(8 (6.1% of 131) adults; 10 (6.7% of 149) juvenile, p-value < 0.01]. Patients with IIM had higher odds of developing TB as compared with SLE [OR 2.24 (CI 1.5-5.5), p=0.007]. The risk of developing active TB was 68-fold and 30.4-fold higher in patients with IIM and SLE, respectively, as compared with the general population. Extrapulmonary forms were more common (14/24). Nearly half developed TB during active IIM, at a glucocorticoid dose of 0.25 (0-1.5) mg/kg/day. Over a follow-up duration of 27 months (8-184), all were cured of TB, though prolonged course of anti-tuberculous treatment was required in 25%, and five IIM relapsed during treatment. Patients with IIM have increased risk of active TB, with common extrapulmonary forms, slow response, and relapses during treatment. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A diagnosis of Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies (IIM) entails significant morbidity, and, at times, even mortality.1 In the developing world, infections are the leading contributor to such morbidity. Tuberculosis (TB) is one such infection, that remains a particular challenge in this part of the world. The emergence of drug-resistant strains has only added to the problem. Polypharmacy, in the setting of chronic illnesses, further compounds the problem. Recent estimates suggest the prevalence of TB in India to be 3.2 cases per thousand population.2 Patients with IIM often require high doses of glucocorticoids for long periods. Poor cough reflex from pharyngeal and respiratory muscle involvement and immobility results in poor handling of both aerosols and oral secretions. Moreover, some patients IIM also have underlying complement pathway defects, such as Mannose Binding Lectin deficiency which is reasonably common and confers a higher risk of TB.3,4 Children are more likely to harbour such inherited deficiencies.5\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597153.7269566}
