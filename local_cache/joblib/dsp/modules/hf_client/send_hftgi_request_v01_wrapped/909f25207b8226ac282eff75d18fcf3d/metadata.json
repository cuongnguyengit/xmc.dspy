ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \"found down\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \u201ccatch up\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: To compare long-term efficacy and safety of immunotherapeutic strategies as maintenance to prevent disease relapses of generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) in real-world settings. This is a retrospective cohort study on generalized MG conducted in seven major neurological centers across China. Eligible participants were patients with generalized MG who were under minimal manifestation status or better. Main outcome measures were probability of patients free of relapses and causes of drug discontinuation. Among 1064 patients enrolled, the median (interquartile range) age was 50.3 (37.0-62.5) years and 641 (60.2%) were women. Disease relapse was significantly lower for rituximab (6.1%) compared with all the other monotherapies (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06 to 0.56, P = .0030). As combination therapies, tacrolimus in combination with corticosteroids reduced risk of disease relapses compared with azathioprine with corticosteroids (HR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.81, P = .0077) or mycophenolate mofetil with corticosteroids (HR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.67, P = .0020). Otherwise, lower-dose corticosteroids or azathioprine as monotherapy significantly increased risk of disease relapses (HR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.94 to 3.99, P < .0001; HR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.23, P = .0003, respectively). The proportion of discontinuation was lowest in patients with rituximab (20.4%) as monotherapy and tacrolimus with corticosteroids (23.6%). Overall, combination treatment of immunosuppressants with corticosteroids had a lower rate of discontinuation compared with corresponding monotherapy (HR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.71, P < .0001). Rituximab as monotherapy and tacrolimus with corticosteroids displayed better clinical efficacy as well as drug maintenance to prevent disease relapses in patients with generalized MG. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoantibody\u2010mediated autoimmune disorder against postsynaptic membrane proteins at the neuromuscular junction, including acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle\u2010specific kinase (MuSK), and lipoprotein receptor\u2010related protein 4 (LRP4). 1 The bulk of generalized MG therapy include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for symptomatic management as well as immunotherapeutic agents to inhibit autoimmunity. Most patients with generalized MG require induction therapy with glucocorticosteroids (steroids), or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), plasma exchange (PE) for severe cases. And immunosuppressants are frequently used for maintenance. A repertoire of classical immunosuppressants, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus have also been adopted. 2 , 3 Some efficacy of an anti\u2010CD20 B\u2010cell depleting agent, rituximab, is demonstrated by sustained clinical improvement with prolonged time to relapse and reduce the need of other immunosuppressants. 4 , 5 , 6 , 7\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to', 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596646.1343284}
