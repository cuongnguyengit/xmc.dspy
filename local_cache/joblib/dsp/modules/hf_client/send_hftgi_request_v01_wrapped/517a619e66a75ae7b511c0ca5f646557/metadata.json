ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: The use of bone turnover marker (BTM) testing for patients with osteoporosis in the USA has not been well characterized. This retrospective US-based real-world data study found BTM testing has some association with treatment decision-making and lower fracture risk in patients with presumed osteoporosis, supporting its use in clinical practice. BACKGROUND The purpose of this study was to characterize bone turnover marker (BTM) testing patterns and estimate their clinical utility in treatment decision-making and fragility fracture risk in patients with osteoporosis using a retrospective claims database. METHODS Data from patients aged \u2265 50 years with newly diagnosed osteoporosis enrolled in the Truven MarketScan\u00ae Commercial Claims and Encounters and Medicare Supplemental and Co-ordination of Benefits databases from January 2008 to June 2018 were included. Osteoporosis was ascertained by explicit claims, fragility fracture events associated with osteoporosis, or prescribed anti-resorptive or anabolic therapy. BTM-tested patients were 1:1 propensity score matched to those untested following diagnosis. Generalized estimating equation models were performed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for testing versus no testing on both treatment decision-making and fragility fracture. RESULTS Of the 457,829 patients with osteoporosis, 6075 were identified with \u2265 1 BTM test following diagnosis; of these patients, 1345 had a unique treatment decision made \u2264 30 days from BTM testing. The percentage of patients receiving BTM tests increased significantly each year (average annual % change: + 8.1%; 95% CI: 5.6-9.0; p = 0.01). Patients tested were significantly more likely to have a treatment decision (OR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.13-1.15), and testing was associated with lower odds of fracture versus those untested (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.85-0.88). CONCLUSIONS In this large, heterogeneous population of patients with presumed osteoporosis, BTM testing was associated with treatment decision-making, likely leading to fragility fracture reduction following use. TEXT: Introduction Osteoporosis, which is characterized by reduced bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration leading to increased bone fragility [1, 2], affects approximately 200 million people worldwide [3]. In 2020, the National Osteoporosis Foundation reported that approximately 54 million Americans, of all ages, are living with osteoporosis or low bone mass [4].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597181.1353137}
