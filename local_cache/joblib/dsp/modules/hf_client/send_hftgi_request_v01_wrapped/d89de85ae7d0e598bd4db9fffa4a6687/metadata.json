ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \"found down\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \u201ccatch up\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Procalcitonin (PCT) is used as a biomarker for identifying the occurrence of sepsis. Previous studies have reported high levels of PCT with acetaminophen intoxication without evidence of infection. Here, we report two patients with acetaminophen intoxication with high levels of PCT without showing any symptoms of bacterial infection. This case study examined two unrelated patients with acetaminophen intoxication admitted to emergency at different times. The first patient was admitted to the emergency department after ingesting approximately 8000 mg (153.8 mg/kg) of acetaminophen. On admission, C-reactive protein (CRP), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were normal. PCT and acetaminophen levels were 31.89 ng/mL and below 0.5 \u03bcg/mL, respectively. The second patient was admitted to the emergency department 8 h after ingesting \u223c23,600 mg (280.6 mg/kg) of acetaminophen. By the second day of admission, GOT and GPT increased to 2508 and 1473 IU/L, respectively. PCT was 45.66 ng/mL with acetaminophen level at 116.9 \u03bcg/mL. Both patients were clear of symptoms associated with bacterial infection. METHODS Acetaminophen intoxication. METHODS N-acetylcysteine was given intravenously to both patients for 20 h per protocol. RESULTS Both patients were discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS Observations suggests that elevated levels of PCT in patients intoxicated with acetaminophen may be associated with involvement of other organs impacted by cytokine stimuli from sterile inflammation resulting from hepatic damage rather than PCT secretion directly caused by hepatic cell damage. TEXT: 1 Introduction Procalcitonin (PCT) is used as an effective biomarker in identifying sepsis as well as to help determine the duration of antibiotics used in a patient.[1\u20135] However, recent studies have shown that bacterial infection may not be the only cause resulting in elevated PCT levels. PCT levels can be elevated in patients experiencing acute liver failure (ALF) associated with acetaminophen intoxication without infection.[5\u20137] This demonstrates that a measure of PCT does not always correlate with the probability of infection.[5\u20137] One study has documented extremely elevated levels of PCT in children with ALF due to acetaminophen intoxication without evidence of bacterial infection that could not be explained by drug induced liver cell injury and/or hidden bacterial infection.[5] Although the exact mechanisms of increased PCT levels in acetaminophen intoxication were unclear, the results of these previous studies suggest that high PCT levels in acetaminophen intoxication might be associated with involvement of other organs affected by cytokine stimuli in addition to liver cell damage.[5\u20137]\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to', 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596645.085047}
