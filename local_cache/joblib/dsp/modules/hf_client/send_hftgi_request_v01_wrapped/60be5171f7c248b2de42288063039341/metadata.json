ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: A 46-year-old man underwent right partial nephrectomy for type 2 papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) in 2011. Lung metastasis and lymph node (LN) metastases around the inferior vena cave appeared in 2012. A right radical nephrectomy and extensive LN dissection was performed and the resection of lung metastasis was performed one month after the nephrectomy. Mediastinal LN metastases occurred in 2013, and resection of the affected LNs was performed. Sunitinib and zoledronic acid was started in 2014 because mediastinal LN swelling and multiple bone metastases appeared. Sunitinib treatment was stopped soon after due to adverse events and axitinib treatment was started. Axitinib was effective and the patient had stable disease for 30 months. Adverse events were successfully controlled by dose reduction and periodic drug withdrawal schedules (for example, 5 days on, 2 days off). Axitinib was further continued for 19 months as the metastatic lesions had progressed slowly. Temsirolimus treatment was started in 2019, but it was stopped after three cycles due to interstitial pneumonia. The patient died 80 months after the initial recurrence. Using multidisciplinary treatment, durable disease control was achieved in a patient with metastatic type 2 PRCC. TEXT: Introductions Recently, the prognosis of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been improved by molecular targeted therapies (1) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (2). However, optimal treatment strategies for metastatic non-clear cell RCC (nccRCC) has yet to be established. In previous studies, molecular targeted therapies, especially sunitinib, have shown clinical efficacy for the treatment of metastatic nccRCC (3-7). The NCCN guidelines (2020 version) indicate that clinical trial or sunitinib is recommended at present for metastatic nccRCC. In nccRCC papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is the leading histology (8). PRCC is divided into type 1 and type 2, with type 2 PRCC showing worse prognosis compared with type 1(9). In phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of sunitinib for metastatic PRCC, overall survival (OS) of type1 PRCC was 17.8 months, and that of type 2 was 12.4 months (10). In this report, we present a patient with metastatic type 2 PRCC whose metastatic lesions were controlled for a long time by multidisciplinary treatments including metastasectomies, axitinib, zoledronic acid (ZA), and radiation therapy.
