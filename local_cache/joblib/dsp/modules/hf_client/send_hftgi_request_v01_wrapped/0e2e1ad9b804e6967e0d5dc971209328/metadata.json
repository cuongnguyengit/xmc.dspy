ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Clinical trials indicated that PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors significantly improve the survival rate of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and induce immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Thus, the molecular and immune characteristics during PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy are worth investigating further. We report the case of a 62-year-old male patient diagnosed with stage IIIA squamous cell lung carcinoma (SQCC) who responded to neoadjuvant and adjuvant nivolumab combined chemotherapy but died from anastomosis leakage or/and irAEs. In the pretreatment tumor biopsy, PD-L1 expression was negative and a few T cells, NK cells, and macrophages had infiltrated the tumor. Wild-type EGFR/STK11, mutant TP53, microsatellite stability, and low tumor mutational burden were also found at baseline. After neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy, the tumor was significantly reduced, PD-L1 expression levels were increased by 50%, and more CD8+ and CD8+ PD-1+ T cells had infiltrated the resected tumor tissue. Immune-related lung injury occurred during adjuvant immunochemotherapy, and serum levels of C-reactive protein, IL-13, IL-4, eotaxin, VEGF-A, IL-8, and IFN-gamma were increased. This case demonstrates a squamous cell lung carcinoma patient who responded to neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy that reshaped the tumor immune environment from \"cold\" to \"hot.\" Unfortunately, the patient eventually died from anastomosis leakage or/and irAEs during adjuvant immunochemotherapy.
