ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Gut dysbiosis may be implicated in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) through immune and/or metabolite pathways. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could reestablish the micro-ecological balance in IgAN, although this has never been attempted before. We explored whether FMT could be efficacious in treating IgAN in two patients with refractory IgAN. Two Chinese female patients with IgAN failed to achieve clinical remission after receiving several rounds of immunosuppressive therapy and suffered from unbearable adverse effects due to immunosuppressants. Both patients received intensive fresh FMT conducted through transendoscopic enteral tubing (TET) regularly for 6-7 months, and were followed up for a further 6 months. Partial clinical remission was achieved in both patients, evidenced by a decrease in the 24-h urinary protein (24-hUP) to less than half of baseline during FMT treatment or follow-up, along with increased serum albumin (sAlb) and stable kidney function. The gut microbiota of both patients was distorted with lower biodiversity and altered composition, which was reversed following FMT. Phylum Proteobacteria decreased while genus Prevotella increased during and after FMT. The intensive fresh FMT was well-tolerated, and no severe adverse events occurred. Preliminary evidence of the safety and efficacy of FMT for treating refractory IgAN may provide a new direction by which to decipher the pathogenesis of IgAN.
