ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: The treatment of adult Burkitt lymphoma with pediatric-based chemotherapy protocols usually results in high cure rates, although with significant toxicity. We report our experience with the Cancer and Leukemia Group B1002 (CALGB 1002) protocol. The files of adult patients diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma and treated with the CALGB 1002 protocol at King Hussein Cancer Center between 2008 and 2017 were reviewed. Baseline demographics, clinical laboratory features, treatment details, and responses were collected. The correlations between clinical and laboratory variables with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were determined by univariate and multivariate analyses using backward stepwise Cox regression models. EFS and OS were plotted using Kaplan-Meier curves. This study included 19 patients with a median age of 33 years (range, 19-65). Eleven (58%) and two (10.5%) patients had advanced-stage and central nervous system disease, respectively. Among 106 administered cycles, the median interval between cycles was 23 days (range, 19-84 days). Sixteen patients (84%) achieved a complete response. After a median follow-up of 40.8 months, the 3-year EFS and OS rates were 78.95%. Patients with a low-risk International Prognostic Index (IPI) had better survival than those with intermediate-or high-risk IPI. Grade III-IV hematological toxicities occurred in 88% of patients, while 73% had grade III-IV mucositis. In adult Burkitt lymphoma, the CALGB 1002 protocol provides high cure rates and can be administered promptly, but is associated with significant toxicity. Risk-adapted approaches and other, less toxic, chemotherapeutic regimens should be considered. TEXT: pmcINTRODUCTION Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) characterized by a high proliferation rate (Ki 67 of approximately 100%) and deregulation of the MYC gene. It is more common in the pediatric age group, peaking around 10 years of age, but accounts for only about 1% of all NHL in adults [1-3]. Clinically, BL often presents with rapidly enlarging masses and extranodal site involvement, especially the bone marrow and central nervous system (CNS). Owing to its rapid growth, early diagnosis and prompt treatment initiation are important [4]. The treatment of BL in adults is challenging because of the lack of randomized trials to define the best initial regimen. Most first-line regimens are adopted from intensive pediatric protocols and include a combination of anthracycline, alkylator, vincristine, etoposide, and agents to treat and prevent CNS disease [5].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597038.2544582}
