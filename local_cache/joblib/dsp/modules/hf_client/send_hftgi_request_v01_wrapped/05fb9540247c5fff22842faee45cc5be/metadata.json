ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Loiasis is an infestation of the skin and eyes caused by the nematode Loa loa. We report a case of loiasis in a woman who contracted the infestation in Cameroon. The clinical picture was characterized by Calabar swellings on the upper limbs and axillary lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests revealed persistent leucocytosis with neutropenia, lymphopenia, and eosinophilia. The search for microfilariae was always negative. The patient was successfully treated with ivermectin and albendazole. Follow-up (5 years) was negative for both clinical manifestations and laboratory tests. TEXT: Introduction Loiasis is an infestation of the skin and eyes caused by the nematode Loa loa. Vectors of the disease are flies of the genus Chrysops (\u201cred fly\u201d). A small number of articles on loiasis in dermatological journals have been published [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. This disease should be known by dermatologists in consideration of the increase of immigrants from poor countries, and tourists who visit tropical and subtropical countries. We present a case of possible loiasis in a woman who contracted the infestation in Cameroon, where loiasis is endemic. A review of the literature published in dermatological journals is included. Case Presentation A 42-year-old Caucasian woman was admitted to our Dermatology Unit in January 2014 because of transient cutaneous itchy swellings and axillary lymphadenopathy of the right upper limb. The patient stated that she visited Cameroon in 2012 and February 2013. In particular, she visited the cities of Yaound\u00e9 and Douala, the region of the Northwest, inhabited by the Fang ethnicity, and the central region, inhabited by the Eton ethnicity. The patient also declared that lymphoedema and axillary lymphadenopathy appeared in May 2013. The patient was subjected at other centres to laboratory tests that revealed leucocytosis (13.500 leucocytes/mm3), with lymphopenia (1.700 lymphocytes/mm3 [12.7%]) and eosinophilia (4.800 eosinophils/mm3 [35.8%]) (July 2013). In the same month, the patient was subjected to ultrasound of axillae that revealed right lymphadenitis. The search for blood microfilariae was negative. In Table 1, the evolution of leucocytes from July 2013 to September 2015 is reported. When the patient was admitted to our Dermatology Unit (January 2014), dermatological examination revealed a mildly erythematous swelling of soft-parenchymatous consistency, 8 cm in size, on the right upper limb (Fig. 1). It lasted 2\u20134 h and was accompanied by pruritus and burning sensation. A clinical diagnosis of Calabar swelling was made. The search for microfilariae was negative at 12:00 a.m. as well as at 12:00 p.m. In July 2014, immunochromatographic test for Loa loa and Wuchereria bancrofti was negative. In March 2015, the search for Loa loa microfilariae was negative. In May 2015, serology for\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597128.7593946}
