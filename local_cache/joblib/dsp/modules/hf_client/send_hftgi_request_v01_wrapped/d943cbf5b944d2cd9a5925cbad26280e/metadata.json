ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has placed great strain on the most developed of health care systems, especially in the context of critical care. Although co-infections with cytomegalovirus (CMV) are frequent in the critically ill due to underlying immune suppression of multiple causes, the impact on COVID-19 patients remains unclear. Furthermore, severe COVID-19 has recently been associated with significant immune suppression, and this may in turn impact CMV reactivation, possibly contributing to clinical course. Nevertheless, multiple confounding factors in these patients will certainly challenge upcoming research. The authors present a case series of five patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) in the context of respiratory failure due to severe COVID-19. All patients evolved with CMV reactivation during ICU stay. TEXT: 1. Introduction The current pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus infection has provoked an unprecedented health care burden worldwide with an abrupt demand for critical care provision and consequent strain on the intensive care unit (ICU) [1]. The experience and knowledge obtained during the past year have allowed the medical community to adapt and treat this emerging disease, but much uncertainty still prevails. A history of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is very common among adults, the majority of which evolve with a period of latency characterized by a persistent control of viral replication [2]. Reactivation usually implies some type of weakened immunity which can be attributed to various etiologies [3]. Nevertheless, infection of immunocompetent patients in the ICU is well acknowledged, with the highest reactivation rates in septic patients. Furthermore, CMV reactivation is associated with higher ICU length of stay, longer need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), increased risk of infections and mortality [4]. D\u2019Ardes et al. were the first to report a case of CMV and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection [5]. Since then, the potentially adverse effects of CMV co-infection on COVID-19 outcome have been approached by recent publications [2]. However, case report publications of CMV co-infection remain relatively scarce [5,6,7,8,9], and the role of COVID-19 itself on CMV reactivation unclear. The authors report a case series of five patients admitted to the ICU due to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who presented concomitant CMV infection/reactivation during ICU stay. 2. Case Presentation 2.1. Patient I A 64-year-old male was admitted to the emergency department (ED) with a 7-day presentation of fever, dry cough, myalgia and chest pain. His past medical history (PMH) included stable human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection (undetectable viral load; CD4+ cell count 321), diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HT) and ischemic heart disease.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597138.9741054}
