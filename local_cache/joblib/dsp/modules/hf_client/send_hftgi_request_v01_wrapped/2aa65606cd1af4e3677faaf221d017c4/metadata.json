ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Our study describes a fatal case of phlegmasia cerulea dolens and massive venous thrombosis in a patient taking rivaroxaban regularly to treat cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Blood tests samples were positive for lupus anticoagulant. The unique evolution of the case, as well as the positivity for lupus anticoagulant, raises the possibility of an acquired hypercoagulation syndrome. We highlight the fact that the test recommended as the first line for lupus anticoagulant diagnosis (dilute Russell viper venom time) is the most affected by rivaroxaban, leading to a high prevalence of false-positive results. We also discuss potential diagnoses for the current case and review the current state-of-the-art of use of the novel oral anticoagulation agents in this unusual situation. So far, there are no recommendations to use such agents as first options in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis or in hypercoagulation syndromes. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare disorder with an annual estimated incidence of up to 4 cases per million and accounting for approximately 0.5% of all patients presenting with stroke-like symptoms.1 The current treatment for CVST is heparin, followed by vitamin K antagonists (VKA) for 3-12 months.2 Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), or non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (DOACs), have emerged as an alternative to VKA, in particular due to the lower risk of intracranial and fatal bleeding. Small case series and case reports have described successful CVST treatment with DOACs. More recently, the exploratory clinical trial RE-SPECT CVT determined the short-term safety and efficacy of dabigatran for preventing recurrent venous thromboembolisms (VTEs) in patients with CVST. We report a unique and fatal case of recurrent massive thrombosis with development of phlegmasia cerulean dolens within 30 days of CVST treatment, while the patient was taking rivaroxaban regularly. The Research Ethics Committee approved this study (protocol No. 23081.004589/2018-03). CASE DESCRIPTION A 44-year-old, hypertensive, African American female presented to the emergency department (ED) with recent onset of pain and bilateral leg edema in conjunction with acute change in mental status. Physical examination showed somnolence, hypotension (blood pressure 80/40 mmHg), and tachycardia (136 bpm). There was leg swelling and cyanosis, more prominent on the left side (Figure 1A). After an unsuccessful volume resuscitation attempt, she was started on norepinephrine with progressively higher doses and only partial hemodynamic improvement. She rapidly progressed to respiratory failure, requiring mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) support.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597164.4074974}
