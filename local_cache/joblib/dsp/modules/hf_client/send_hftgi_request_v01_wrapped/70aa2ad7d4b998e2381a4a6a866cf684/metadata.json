ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Ipilimumab and nivolumab are immune checkpoint inhibitors that have recently been used in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and other cancers. Immune-mediated colitis is one of their adverse events that need to be differentiated from low-grade diarrhea as one of the most common side effects. A 51-year-old woman with relapsed metastatic melanoma presented with intractable diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and generalized abdominal pain. The patient had been treated with ipilimumab and nivolumab in the past two months. The infectious workup was inconclusive. Colonoscopy demonstrated severe colitis, and biopsies were consistent with colitis. Combination chemotherapy was stopped. The patient was treated with intravenous and oral steroids, and her symptoms improved. A combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab increases the chance of immune-mediated colitis, and steroids should be started promptly to avoid complications such as bowel perforation and toxic megacolon. TEXT: Introduction Drug-induced colitis is historically found as a reaction to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory and antibiotic medications [1]. After the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of metastatic melanomas and other cancers, immune-mediated colitis was reported as one of the immune-related adverse events (irAEs) [2]. Ipilimumab and nivolumab are monoclonal antibodies against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), respectively [1,3-4]. They both increase the activity of T cells against cancerous cells and can simultaneously result in the stimulation of T cells against non-cancerous tissues such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract [3]. The reported incidence of colitis is about five times greater with ipilimumab as compared to nivolumab and is 13.6% with combination therapy [3]. This article was partly presented as a virtual meeting abstract at the 2020 American College of Gastroenterology.
