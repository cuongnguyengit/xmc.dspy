ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Anti-TNF antibodies were the first biologic treatment option for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. To assess length of treatment persistence of first anti-TNF therapy and influencing factors used in the standard care of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases. Single-centre, retrospective study from a register including patients who received anti-TNF therapy in the last 20 years at the study centre. Kaplan-Meier analysis with log-rank test was used to describe treatment persistence. With multivariable Cox regression analysis, risk factors for treatment failure were investigated. Five hundred thirty-eight patients (CD, Crohn's disease: 367, UC, ulcerative colitis: 147, inflammatory bowel disease unclassified: 24) with a median follow-up of 8.1 years were included. Median (95% confidence interval) treatment persistence in the total cohort was 2.3 years (28 [22, 38] months), and nearly half of patients withdrew from treatment within 2 years. Male patients were treated longer than females (male: 37 [25, 48] months, female: 23 [14, 33] months, P = 0.002). Treatment persistence was longer in CD compared to UC (CD: 39 [30, 50] months, UC: 13 [9, 19] months, P < 0.001), and patients with CD remained longer on adalimumab than on infliximab treatment (adalimumab: 67 [55, 95] months, infliximab: 19 [14, 31] months, P < 0.001). Treatment failure (52%) and side effects (25%) were the most common reasons for withdrawal from therapy; 14% withdrew due to remission. Female sex was identified as independent predictor for treatment failure in UC (hazard ratio [CI]: 1.73 [1.02-2.92], P = 0.04). Long-term treatment persistence of first anti-TNF therapy was limited in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, primarily due to treatment failure and side effects. TEXT: pmc1 INTRODUCTION Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic immune\u2010mediated inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract presenting most commonly with chronic diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Causes of these diseases are still poorly understood. Microbiome alterations with epithelial barrier defects, genetic susceptibility and environmental factors are thought to lead to an imbalance of innate and adaptive immune responses.1, 2\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597152.6248739}
