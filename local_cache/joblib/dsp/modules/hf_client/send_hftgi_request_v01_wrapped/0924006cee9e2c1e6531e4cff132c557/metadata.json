ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: In case of AAV with kidney involvement, physicians should explore anti-GBM antibodies and be aware of the possible sequential development of AAV, especially with MPO-ANCA, and anti-GBM glomerulonephritis. This sequential disease history is associated with a poor renal outcome, highlighting the need for urgent diagnosis and management. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION Double\u2010positive vasculitis for ANCA and anti\u2010GBM antibodies simultaneously is well described. Conversely, cases of sequential development of anti\u2010GBM disease after ANCA\u2010associated vasculitis are exceptionally reported. We describe 2 cases of ANCA\u2010associated vasculitis followed by anti\u2010GBM disease, suggesting that glomerular damages due to ANCA\u2010associated vasculitis could induce an anti\u2010GBM glomerulonephritis. Antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) targeting myeloperoxidase (MPO) are commonly found in antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) disease. The association of small vessel vasculitis double positive for ANCA and anti\u2010GBM antibodies occurring simultaneously is well described. 1 , 2 In contrast, sequential development of ANCA\u2010associated vasculitis (AAV) followed by anti\u2010GBM disease is rarely reported. Recently, evidence suggests that glomerular damages due to ANCA\u2010associated glomerulonephritis could reveal sequestered epitopes of the GBM, inducing an anti\u2010GBM immune response. A survey across tertiary centers for the management of vasculitis affiliated to the French Vasculitis Study Group allowed us to identify two cases of AAV followed by biopsy\u2010proven anti\u2010GBM disease: a 60\u2010year\u2010old man with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) and a 23\u2010year\u2010old woman with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). Despite prompt management, adequate induction therapy, and plasma exchanges, the first case reached end\u2010stage renal disease and the second case experienced a relapsing anti\u2010GBM glomerulonephritis. The sequential occurrence of the two diseases is exceptionally reported in the literature, affecting preferentially elderly males with MPO\u2010ANCA and a poor renal prognosis. 2 CASE 1 A 60\u2010year\u2010old man with a history of asthma and chronic sinusitis presented a chronic nonproductive cough, recurrent fever, and limbs\u2019 neuropathic pain. Blood tests revealed persistent eosinophilia with mild inflammatory syndrome. Renal function and urine sediment were normal. Chest\u2010computed tomography showed a diffuse interstitial lung disease with micronodules. Electroneuromyography revealed multiple mononeuropathy. Infectious serological tests and parasitological investigations were negative. Serum complement levels were normal. Antinuclear antibodies and serum cryoglobulins were negative. ANCA were positive, identified as MPO\u2010ANCA. The patient was diagnosed with EGPA. High\u2010dose glucocorticoids led to clinical improvement, allowing a slow tapering and withdrawal three years later.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597049.9976711}
