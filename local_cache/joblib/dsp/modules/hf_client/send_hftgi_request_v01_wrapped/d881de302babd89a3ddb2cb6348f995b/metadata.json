ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: Endoscopic shielding is an innovative concept in therapeutic endoscopy. Its usage has been mostly restricted to wide-field endoscopic mucosal resection and/or endoscopic submucosal dissection. A novel potential clinical use may be in bleeding pophylaxis for argon plasma coagulation-related ulcers under concomitant mandatory dual antiplatelet therapy. TEXT: While in broad clinical use in many fields of surgery, endoscopic shielding is considered quite a novel concept in interventional endoscopy, for example, for large postresectional lesions [endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and/or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)], with available data indicating prevention of late perforation and/or bleeding as well as accelerated tissue repair/healing.1 Apart from polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets, another biocompatible, naturally absorbable hemostatic substance for endoscopic applications is oxidized regenerated cellulose, which is less expensive and more broadly available.2 Apart from endoscopic shielding for endoscopic resection procedures, there is an ever\u2010increasing set of clinical applications in interventional endoscopy reported, including perforation and/or fistula closure, difficult\u2010to\u2010treat bleeding situations, and\u2014among others\u2014stricture prevention following esophageal ESD procedures.3, 4, 5 However, argon plasma coagulation (APC), for which endoscopic shielding has not yet been reported, is by itself considered a low\u2010risk procedure in terms of bleeding in recent guidelines, however, clinical caution is mandatory in the presence of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Delayed bleeding and/or perforation after APC application, especially in the cecal pole, may occur and may have deleterious consequences in patients with recent coronary stent interventions. From such reasoning, here, the first report on preventive endoscopic shielding of an APC site in such a complex clinical setting is presented. Of note, mandatory DAPT indications are becoming more and more common in increasingly aging populations with a high comorbidity of advanced cardiovascular disease and colorectal angiodysplasia.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596055.0179925}
