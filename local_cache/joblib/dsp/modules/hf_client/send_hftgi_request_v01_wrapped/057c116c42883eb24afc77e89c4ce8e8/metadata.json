ABSTRACT: Conventional skeletal chondrosarcoma is a bone neoplasm, which is poorly sensitive to anthracyclines-based chemotherapy. We report on an 18-month-long tumour response to gemcitabine as single agent in a young patient with an advanced secondary peripheral conventional chondrosarcoma, previously treated unsuccessfully with anthracyclines, ifosfamide, platinum, etoposide. TEXT: Background The skeletal chondrosarcoma family represents a heterogeneous group of malignant bone mesenchymal tumours characterised by the production of a chondroid matrix. They are the third bone sarcoma in incidence, and the most frequent in adults. There are three main subtypes: conventional, mesenchymal, and clear-cell. A \u201cdedifferentiated\u201d chondrosarcoma develops in 10-15% of conventional chondrosarcomas, while mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a high-grade, aggressive neoplasm with a natural history and chemosensitivity that might be close to Ewing sarcoma, and clear-cell chondrosarcoma is a low-grade variant [1]. In conventional chondrosarcoma (cCS), the histological malignancy grade is the main prognostic factor [2]. Grade 1 cCS are characterised by a very low metastatic potential, and some authors have quite recently suggested a re-classification of these types as \u201catypical cartilaginous tumours\u201d [1]. Grade 2 and 3 cCS are marked by a higher metastatic potential, with a 10-year survival of 64-86% and 29-55% respectively [3,4]. CCSs are also categorised according to their location in the bone: a central chondrosarcoma onsets in the medullary cavity, a small percentage of them from a pre-existing benign lesion known as enchondroma, while a peripheral variant arises from the surface of the bone, as a result of malignant progression of a pre-existing benign (solitary or hereditary) osteochondroma. Surgery is the mainstay of the treatment of localized disease. While curettage is acceptable for grade 1 cCS, wide excision is usually required for higher grade cCS, with the exception of skull base cCS which may be treated with radiotherapy. In particular, hadrons can play an important role in the management of skull base cCS, and very good outcomes are reported [5].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon and life-threating condition characterized by major immune activation and massive cytokine production by mononuclear inflammatory cells, due to defects in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. It is even more unusual in renal transplant recipients, in which it is often associated with uncontrolled infection. The mortality is high in HLH and differential diagnosis with sepsis is a challenge. The approach and management depend on the underlying trigger and comorbidities. We report a case of a 50-year-old renal transplant female admitted with fever and malaise 3 months post-transplant and presenting anemia, fever, hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of serum ferritin, and positive CMV antigenemia. Urine was positive for decoy cells and BKV-DNA. Graft biopsy showed CMV nephritis. Both blood and urine cultures where positive for E. coli. Hemophagocytosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone, with complete response after 3 weeks. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of a rare and serious condition in a renal transplant patient, which can allow a favorable clinical course and improve survival rate. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) consists of an immune hyperactivation syndrome that takes place when NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to eliminate activated macrophages, leading to over production of proinflammatory cytokines1. There are primary and acquired causes. Primary HLH is rare and typically manifests in childhood because of two autosomal recessive defects in genes that encode proteins involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules during apoptosis in natural killer (NK) cells.1 , 2Acquired (secondary) HLH is triggered by various conditions as infections, immunodeficiency, rheumatologic diseases, and cancer.1 , 3 , 4 Infection is the most common precipitating factor of HLH in adults, mainly viruses of herpes family (EBV, CMV, HSV, HHV8), but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens can also be a trigger.5 , 6 Multiorgan involvement and organomegaly are frequently found and hemophagocytosis results in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of HLH is based on the presence of at least 5 of the following 8 criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting \u2265 2 lineages of peripheral blood cells), hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, serum ferritin >500 ng/mL, low activity of NK cells, soluble CD25 > 2.400 U/mL and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes.7 Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red cells, platelets, or white cells in macrophage cytoplasm visualized in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.2 The syndrome is defined by a complex picture. However, some patients may have incipient or partial disease.1 Most diagnostic\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: Children are more exposed to inappropriate medicine use and its consequent harms. Spontaneous reporting of suspected Serious Adverse Drug Reactions (SADR) increases knowledge and prevention of pharmacotherapy risk. Disproportionality measures are useful to quantify unexpected safety issues associated with a given drug-event pair (signals of disproportionality). This cross-sectional study aimed to assess SADR reporting and safety signals for Brazilian children from 0-12 years old, notified between January 2008 and December 2013 from the Brazilian Surveillance Agency (Notivisa). Information from serious reports (gender and age of the patient, event description, suspected drug) was included. Disproportionality analysis based on Reporting Odds Ratios with a confidence interval of 95% was conducted to identify possible signals of disproportionate reporting (SDR). Almost 30% of 1,977 suspected SADR was related to babies (0-1-year-old). 69% of reports happened with intravenous dosage forms, and 35% of suspected SADR involved off label use according to age. Laronidase, miglustat, imipenem/cilastatin, and clofarabine were involved in six or more suspected deaths among 75 deaths reported. There were 107 SDRs, of which 16 events (15%) were not described in the product labels. There was a relatively higher number of SADRs in Brazilian children compared with studies from other countries. SDRs found, (especially drug-event pairs 'imipenen/cilastatin-pneumonia' and 'laronidase-respiratory insufficiency') should be investigated more. The reports of SADR with IV dosage forms and OL drug use suggest the need for drug research and the use of better dosage forms for children in Brazil. TEXT: Introduction Ensuring safety, efficacy, and quality of medicines for the pediatric population is a challenge because data on many medicines are scarce due to the lack of clinical trials involving children (Joseph et al., 2015). As a result, children may be exposed to age-inappropriate medicines that can lead to increased incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) (Bellis et al., 2014). Risk factors associated with ADRs in children include polypharmacy, age, off-label (OL) use, and unlicensed (UL) use (Bellis et al., 2014; Lombardi et al., 2018). Reports of ADRs screening from surveillance systems may offer information about a different drug\u2010event combination (or pairs) by the mining of a large volume of data (Harpaz et al., 2012). Such safety signals\u2014a potentially causal association or a new aspect of a known association between an intervention and a set of related events\u2014may be critical for drug regulation and improvements in child health (CIOMS, 2010; Osokogu et al., 2016).\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596325.0856826}
