ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Trifluridine/tipiracil is currently approved for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) refractory to available therapies. However, there is no consensus on factors that predict treatment outcomes in daily practice. We assessed the early clinical experience with trifluridine/tipiracil in Spain and potential survival markers. This was a retrospective cohort study of mCRC patients who participated in the trifluridine/tipiracil early clinical experience programme in Spain. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Associations between OS and patient characteristics were assessed using multivariate Cox regression analyses. A total of 379 patients were included in the study. Trifluridine/tipiracil was administered for a median of 3.0 cycles and discontinued mainly due to disease progression (79.2%). The median OS was 7.9 months, with a 12-month OS rate of 30.5%. Cox analyses revealed that the following variables independently enhanced OS: \u22642 metastatic sites, no liver metastasis, alkaline phosphatase < 300 IU, trifluridine/tipiracil dose reductions, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio < 5. Grade \u2265 3 toxicities were reported in 141 (37.2%) patients, including mainly afebrile neutropaenia (23.2%), anaemia (12.1%), and thrombocytopaenia (5.3%). This study supports the real-life efficacy and safety of trifluridine/tipiracil for refractory mCRC and identifies tumour burden, liver metastasis, alkaline phosphatase, dose reductions, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio as survival markers. TEXT: pmc1. Introduction Colorectal cancer is one of the three most commonly diagnosed cancers and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide [1]. Only 39% of colorectal cancer patients are diagnosed with localised disease, and despite the improvements achieved in its management, the 5-year survival of patients with distant metastases drops to 14% [2]. Current therapies for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) involve several active drugs administered either as monotherapy or in combination, including cytotoxic agents such as fluoropyrimidines, irinotecan or oxaliplatin, and targeted therapies against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [3,4]. However, the therapeutic management of mCRC refractory to these therapies remains challenging.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597132.8646078}
