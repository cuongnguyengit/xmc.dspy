ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Drug-induced aseptic meningitis is a rare, but challenging diagnosis, most commonly reported with nonsteoroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is a sulfonamide that is widely used in clinical practice for the treatment and prophylaxis of various infections. The most common side effects associated with TMP/SMX are generally mild and self-limited, but serious side effects have been reported, including liver injury and aseptic meningitis. We report a 2,5 year old Dutch girl with both drug-induced aseptic meningitis and drug-induced liver injury while using TMP/SMX prophylaxis. Ursodeoxycholic acid was started because of cholestatic injury. After cessation of TMP/SMX, full convalescence was reached within weeks. This is the first report of a young patient with both aseptic meningitis and drug-induced liver injury caused by TMP/SMX. Drug-induced aseptic meningitis and cholestatic hepatitis constitute a considerable diagnostic challenge to clinicians. In addition to a thorough evaluation for infectious causes, clinicians should be aware of drug-induced aseptic meningitis and cholestatic hepatitis. TEXT: Background Drug-induced aseptic meningitis is a known adverse reaction to some drugs, including antibiotics. A frequently implicated antibiotic is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Several cases of TMP/SMX aseptic meningitis have been reported in literature and (as individual case safety reports) to pharmacovigilance databases for drug monitoring. In pediatric patients, only a few cases have been reported, with the youngest being 3 years old [1\u20135]. Another known adverse effect of TMP/SMX, even more rare in children, is drug-induced liver injury. In recent literature only one pediatric case has been published with both drug-induced aseptic meningitis and hepatitis, reporting a 16-year old girl using TMP/SMX together with valproic acid [4]. To our knowledge, our case is the first report of a young patient with TMP/SMX-induced aseptic meningitis and hepatitis without other drugs involved. Drug-induced aseptic meningitis or cholestatic hepatitis are a considerable diagnostic challenge to clinicians, as shown by the presented case.
