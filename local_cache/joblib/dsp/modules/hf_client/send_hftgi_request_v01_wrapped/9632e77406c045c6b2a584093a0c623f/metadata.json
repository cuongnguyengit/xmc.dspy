ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Like other halogenated agents, sevoflurane can potentially cause a toxic reaction including severe hepatic failure which can lead to the death of the patient. However, Halogen immuno-allergic hepatitis is a very rare complication of anesthesia. We reported a 10 months' child who presented a severe hepatic injury after sevoflurane exposure. A 10-month-old child was scheduled for acute intussusception anesthesia, induction was done with sevoflurane and propofol while maintenance of anesthesia was provided by sevoflurane alone. Three days after the operation, he was developed jaundice and altered general condition. A dramatic increase in liver enzymes was observed. The evolution was marked by an alteration of his consciousness and his hemodynamic state, he was intubated. Without improvement, the patient died on the 4th postoperative day. The autopsy was refused by the family. These results underscore the need findings for a global and comprehensive understanding of the potential hepatotoxicity of exposure to volatile anesthetics including sevoflurane in infants and its long-term side effects which can be fatal. TEXT: pmc1 Introduction Sevoflurane is a substance that is foreign to human organism. As other halogenated agents, it can potentially cause a toxic reaction. It is widely used because it is considered as a safe inhaled anesthetic, Especially in patients with liver disease [1]. Theoretically, all organs can be touch by its toxicity especially those who are implicated in its metabolism and elimination, since they the organs where concentrations are at its highest. This is particularly the case of the liver [2]. Indeed, a few cases of hepatotoxicity have been reported in the literature since its use in anesthesia. No test, including liver biopsy, is specific enough to assert cytolytic hepatitis related to halogens. The diagnosis approach therefore remains based on the anamnesis and other cause of liver injury differential diagnosis elimination, notably infectious, autoimmune, metabolic or hemodynamic etiology. We report a case of severe hepatic injury in an infant underwent a cure of Intussusception with administration of sevoflurane as maintenance agent. 2 Case management We report the case of a 10-month-old child from Morocco, resulting from a well-followed pregnancy with a post-term cesarean delivery. The child had a birth weight of 4kg250mg, Good psychomotor development, vaccinated according to the national vaccination program. He had no previous medical, family, psychosocial and genetic history, with no notion of blood transfusions, antibiotics, intravenous drug use, or exposure to other chemicals and hepatotoxic drugs.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597163.8467917}
