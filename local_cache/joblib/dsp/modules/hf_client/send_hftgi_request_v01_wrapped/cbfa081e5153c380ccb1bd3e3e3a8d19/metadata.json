ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: The patient is a 69-year-old male with a past medical history of intellectual disability, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-associated angioedema who presented to the emergency department with difficulty breathing. On physical examination, the patient had significant facial edema. Nasal fiber-optic visualization revealed extensive airway edema involving the supraglottic region and the arytenoids. The patient was successfully intubated through the collective teamwork of ENT, anesthesia, and critical care teams. He was managed in the intensive care unit until recovery. Workup for markers for allergic causes of angioedema were within normal limits. Further investigation revealed that symptoms developed following the initiation of a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-IV) inhibitor. The angiotensin-converting enzyme and DPP-IV play a significant role in the metabolism of bradykinin and substance P to their inactive metabolites. The complex interplay between the enzymes in the high-molecular-weight kininogen (HWMK) system may increase the risk of angioedema in patients with a known history of ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema when placed on a DPP-IV inhibitor. This case report highlights the pathophysiology involved. TEXT: Introduction Postmarketing surveillance reports show that the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-IV) inhibitor is associated with angioedema development. Angioedema occurs as a result of an allergic or nonallergic reaction to the medication. Although a rare adverse effect, the DPP-IV inhibitor\u2013associated angioedema could be severe and life-threatening. Nonallergic angioedema results due to a disruption in the high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK) system. Enzymes including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), neutral endopeptidase (NEP), and DPP-IV works to metabolize bradykinin and substance P. The complex interplay of the enzymes on the HMWK system may result in an increased risk of angioedema when medications inhibit the pathway like ACE inhibitors and DPP-IV inhibitors. Case Presentation The patient was a 69-year-old male with a past medical history of intellectual disability, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus who presented to the emergency department (ED) with difficulty breathing and tongue swelling. The patient lived in a group home that provided the skilled support he needed for day-to-day activities. The patient was transferred due to acute difficulty breathing, accompanied by facial swelling. His symptoms started an hour before the presentation. Initial vital signs in the ED revealed a temperature of 99 \u00b0F, heart rate of 72 bpm, blood pressure of 164/88 mm Hg, and his oxygen saturation (SpO2) 98% on room air.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597159.9338007}
