ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Although the WALANT technique's long-term safeness has been demonstrated in many studies, there are only few data investigating its short-term effects on tissue perfusion and oxygen levels. It was hypothesized that, temporarily, critical levels of tissue perfusion may occur. METHODS Seventeen patients, who were scheduled for different procedures in WALANT technique, were injected with 5-7 ml of 1% Articain containing 1:200,000 epinephrine at the finger base. Capillary-venous oxygen saturation, hemoglobin volume in the capillaries, and relative blood flow in the fingertips were recorded once per second by white light spectrometry and laser Doppler flowmetry before, during and after injection for an average of 32 min. RESULTS Clinically, no persistent tissue malperfusion was observed, and there were no postoperative complications. Capillary-venous oxygen saturation was reduced by \u2265 30% in seven patients. Critical levels of oxygen saturation were detected in four patients during 13 intervals, each lasting for 132.5 s on average. Oxygen saturation returned to noncritical values in all patients by the end of the observation period. Blood flow in the fingertips was reduced by more than 30% in nine patients, but no critical levels were observed, as with the hemoglobin. Three patients demonstrated a reactive increase in blood flow of more than 30% after injection. CONCLUSIONS Injection of tumescent local anesthesia containing epinephrine into finger base may temporarily cause a substantial reduction in blood flow and lead to critical levels of oxygen saturation in the fingertips. However, this was fully reversible within minutes and does not cause long-term complications.
