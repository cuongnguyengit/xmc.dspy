ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Cases of late onset neutropenia (LON) after rituximab therapy have been documented, but few cases have been documented of early onset neutropenia (EON). We present a case report of a patient with mantle cell lymphoma who presented with EON, only 6 days after initiation of rituximab therapy, notable for the shortest duration to EON ever reported in literature. Throughout this paper, we explore the potential pathogenesis and incidence of EON with the help of our unique case. TEXT: Introduction Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen found on B-cell lymphocytes, both normal and malignant [1]. Originally, rituximab was administered only for treatment of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas [2], but now its use encompasses other cancers and rheumatic diseases, with a common one being refractory systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [2]. Generally, rituximab has safe side effect profile when compared to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy [1, 2]. Infusion reactions, infections, fever, and hypotension are the most common side effects [1, 2]. Many recent reports of late onset neutropenia (LON) have been documented; however, early onset neutropenia (EON) is very rare and has only been documented in approximately seven patients [1-3]. EON is defined as neutropenia occurring within 4 weeks of starting treatment, and LON is anything later than 4 weeks [2, 3]. In this report, we detail a patient with mantle cell lymphoma who developed grade 4 EON after treatment with just one dose of rituximab in 6 days. Case Report A 65-year-old man was admitted to our hospital due to neutropenic fever. He was initially diagnosed with high-risk stage IV mantle cell lymphoma involving the bone marrow and right pleural effusion and was treated in January 2020 at an outside institution with bendamustine and rituximab after his initial diagnosis; subsequently, he developed grade 3 neutropenia with anasarca. He was later seen at our institution, and the regimen was then transitioned to single agent ibrutinib which he tolerated well for 5 months with no significant cytopenias. On progression, rituximab was added to the regimen to improve therapeutic response. In July 2020, he had received his first dose of rituximab 375 mg/m2 while continuing ibrutinib. A repeat complete blood count (CBC) drawn 6 days after administration showed an undetectable absolute neutrophil count (ANC) level, and ibrutinib was held. He presented to the emergency department (ED) with new onset neutropenic fever with temperature of 38.3 \u00b0C, white blood cell (WBC) count of 3.06 \u00d7 109/L, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of < 0.03 \u00d7 103/L, hemoglobin of 10.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 197 \u00d7 109/L. Urine cultures, head computed tomography (CT), chest X-ray, and port cultures were negative during his hospital stay. Physical examination was benign for any pertinent findings.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597063.71411}
