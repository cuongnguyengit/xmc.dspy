ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Extravasation of Epirubicin chemotherapy from a port-a-cath causing extensive breast necrosis: Sequential imaging findings and management of a breast cancer patient. ABSTRACT: Extravasation of chemotherapy is rare with an estimated incidence of 0.01%-7% but can cause significant morbidity, delay in cancer treatment and potential mortality. We present a case of 55-year-old woman with a metastatic right axillary lymph node with no identifiable breast primary, commenced on chemotherapy as per multidisciplinary team decision. Extravasation of 25 mls of Epirubicin chemotherapy at the porta-a-cath (site) caused extensive inflammatory change in the breast parenchyma and chest wall with a necrotic ulcerating skin-defect. Even with ensuring port or peripheral catheter patency and position, extravasation can occur. This is the first case report to describe the use of MRI to help plan management, identifying the extent of the tissue damage and vascular compromise which could impair healing. In this case the necrotic ulcer was managed with surgical debridement and human ADM matrix (Matriderm dermal matrix) which has not been described in the literature previously. TEXT: pmcCase report A 55-year-old woman attended the accident and emergency department at a tertiary referral centre with extensive skin necrosis of the right breast and was referred to the Breast Unit for management. She had initially presented to a regional hospital three weeks prior, with a one-month history of a mass in the right axilla. Clinical examination at that time identified a 40 mm mobile axillary mass with normal breast examination. Digital mammograms identified a 30 mm well defined dense rounded mass overlying the right axilla (M3), only partially imaged on the medial lateral oblique view (Fig. 1). Ultrasound (US) of the right axilla confirmed a well-defined lobulated hypoechoic mass 45 mm x 31 mm in keeping with a right level one axillary lymph node which was suspicious for malignancy (U4) (Fig. 2). Histology of the US guided core biopsy (2 \u00d7 16 gauge) of the axilla identified a metastatic lymph node of ductal carcinoma type, grade 3, oestrogen receptor (ER) positive (8/8), progesterone receptor (PR) positive (8/8) and Herceptin 2 receptor positive.Fig. 1 A: Right MLO mammogram identified a 30 mm well defined dense rounded mass overlying the right axilla (M3). B: The mass was not identified on the CC view as too posterior and superior on this view. No mass identified on the CC view as the mass was too posterior and superior.
