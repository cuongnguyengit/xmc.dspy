ABSTRACT: Conventional skeletal chondrosarcoma is a bone neoplasm, which is poorly sensitive to anthracyclines-based chemotherapy. We report on an 18-month-long tumour response to gemcitabine as single agent in a young patient with an advanced secondary peripheral conventional chondrosarcoma, previously treated unsuccessfully with anthracyclines, ifosfamide, platinum, etoposide. TEXT: Background The skeletal chondrosarcoma family represents a heterogeneous group of malignant bone mesenchymal tumours characterised by the production of a chondroid matrix. They are the third bone sarcoma in incidence, and the most frequent in adults. There are three main subtypes: conventional, mesenchymal, and clear-cell. A \u201cdedifferentiated\u201d chondrosarcoma develops in 10-15% of conventional chondrosarcomas, while mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a high-grade, aggressive neoplasm with a natural history and chemosensitivity that might be close to Ewing sarcoma, and clear-cell chondrosarcoma is a low-grade variant [1]. In conventional chondrosarcoma (cCS), the histological malignancy grade is the main prognostic factor [2]. Grade 1 cCS are characterised by a very low metastatic potential, and some authors have quite recently suggested a re-classification of these types as \u201catypical cartilaginous tumours\u201d [1]. Grade 2 and 3 cCS are marked by a higher metastatic potential, with a 10-year survival of 64-86% and 29-55% respectively [3,4]. CCSs are also categorised according to their location in the bone: a central chondrosarcoma onsets in the medullary cavity, a small percentage of them from a pre-existing benign lesion known as enchondroma, while a peripheral variant arises from the surface of the bone, as a result of malignant progression of a pre-existing benign (solitary or hereditary) osteochondroma. Surgery is the mainstay of the treatment of localized disease. While curettage is acceptable for grade 1 cCS, wide excision is usually required for higher grade cCS, with the exception of skull base cCS which may be treated with radiotherapy. In particular, hadrons can play an important role in the management of skull base cCS, and very good outcomes are reported [5].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon and life-threating condition characterized by major immune activation and massive cytokine production by mononuclear inflammatory cells, due to defects in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. It is even more unusual in renal transplant recipients, in which it is often associated with uncontrolled infection. The mortality is high in HLH and differential diagnosis with sepsis is a challenge. The approach and management depend on the underlying trigger and comorbidities. We report a case of a 50-year-old renal transplant female admitted with fever and malaise 3 months post-transplant and presenting anemia, fever, hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of serum ferritin, and positive CMV antigenemia. Urine was positive for decoy cells and BKV-DNA. Graft biopsy showed CMV nephritis. Both blood and urine cultures where positive for E. coli. Hemophagocytosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone, with complete response after 3 weeks. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of a rare and serious condition in a renal transplant patient, which can allow a favorable clinical course and improve survival rate. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) consists of an immune hyperactivation syndrome that takes place when NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to eliminate activated macrophages, leading to over production of proinflammatory cytokines1. There are primary and acquired causes. Primary HLH is rare and typically manifests in childhood because of two autosomal recessive defects in genes that encode proteins involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules during apoptosis in natural killer (NK) cells.1 , 2Acquired (secondary) HLH is triggered by various conditions as infections, immunodeficiency, rheumatologic diseases, and cancer.1 , 3 , 4 Infection is the most common precipitating factor of HLH in adults, mainly viruses of herpes family (EBV, CMV, HSV, HHV8), but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens can also be a trigger.5 , 6 Multiorgan involvement and organomegaly are frequently found and hemophagocytosis results in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of HLH is based on the presence of at least 5 of the following 8 criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting \u2265 2 lineages of peripheral blood cells), hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, serum ferritin >500 ng/mL, low activity of NK cells, soluble CD25 > 2.400 U/mL and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes.7 Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red cells, platelets, or white cells in macrophage cytoplasm visualized in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.2 The syndrome is defined by a complex picture. However, some patients may have incipient or partial disease.1 Most diagnostic\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: A single dose of pegfilgrastim or the daily administration of colony-stimulating factors can be used to prevent febrile neutropenia. This may delay the detection of rapidly progressive infections among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. We report a case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremic pneumonia that occurred in a patient receiving pegfilgrastim. TEXT: Introduction With the spread of outpatient chemotherapy, pegfilgrastim has been used for the prevention of febrile neutropenia (FN) because its prolonged half-life permits single-dose administration. However, cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are always at risk of invasive infections regardless of the presence of neutropenia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremic pneumonia (PABP) is an infection that is usually fatal, which generally occurs in neutropenic patients undergoing chemotherapy. This is the first report of a case of PABP in a solid cancer patient without neutropenia following outpatient chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim treatment. Case Report A 69-year-old man presented with high fever and general fatigue. He had been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer with multiple lung metastases two and a half years previously. He had been treated with gemcitabine (GEM) for two years and then TS-1 for 1 month. He developed FN after his first course of third-line chemotherapy with navelbine plus GEM due to progressive disease. Thereafter, he received outpatient chemotherapy along with pegfilgrastim. Fourteen days after the fifth course of third-line chemotherapy, he visited the hospital on the date of his scheduled outpatient appointment. He had a high fever (39\u00b0C) and general fatigue and was admitted to hospital with a suspected lung abscess. On admission, the patient had no cough, sputum, dyspnea, chest pain, headache, or vomiting. He had no known contact with sick individuals. A physical examination revealed a body temperature of 39.0\u00b0C, a pulse rate of 66 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and blood pressure of 90/56 mmHg. Lungs auscultation was clear, with the exception of decreased breath sounds in the right lung. No heart murmur was audible. There was mild pitting edema in his lower legs. Chest radiography on arrival showed consolidation in the upper field of the right lung (Fig. 1). Computed tomography (CT) disclosed a cavitary lesion, measuring 45\u00d743 mm, with surrounding inflammation in the right upper lobe (Fig. 2). The laboratory data showed that he did not have neutropenia (white blood cell [WBC] count, 44,700/\u03bcL [neutrophils, 93%]). The other values were as follows: hemoglobin, 8.7 g/dL; platelets, 239,000/\u03bcL; aspirate aminotransferase, 24 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 15 U/L; lactic dehydrogenase, 272 U/L; total protein, 5.3 g/dL; albumin, 2.1 g/dL; creatinine, 0.87 mg/dL; serum urea nitrogen, 26 mg/dL; and C-reactive protein, 7.9 mg/dL.
