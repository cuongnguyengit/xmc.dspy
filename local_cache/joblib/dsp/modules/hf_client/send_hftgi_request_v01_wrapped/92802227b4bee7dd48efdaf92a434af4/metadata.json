ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Mycobacteria avium-related peritonitis in a patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis: case report and review of the literature. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Mycobacteria avium (M. avium) is a species of ubiquitous slowly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria. It causes opportunistic infections. However, M. avium-related peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients is rare. METHODS A 51-year-old female end-stage kidney disease patient undergoing PD was admitted for a noninfectious complication. She presented catheter exit site drainage and slightly increased PD effluent white cell count (WCC) with polymorphonuclear predominance on admission. Exit site infection and PD-related peritonitis were diagnosed. Repeated cultures of effluent and drainage were negative. Initial empirical antibiotics and further adjustment were not rewarding. PD was terminated 2 weeks later, however, shortly the patient developed stupor, high fever, peritoneal irritation, and spontaneous chylous ascites, and showed elevated ascitic adenosine deaminase (ADA). The manifestations persisted and the patient's general condition deteriorated despite intensified antibiotic therapy. Massive parallel sequencing identified M. avium in ascites on hospital day 25, and 4-drug treatment with azithromycin, amikacin, rifampin, and ethambutol was initiated. Nevertheless, the patient died from sepsis on hospital day 30. CONCLUSIONS We report a case of PD-related M. avium peritonitis. Prolonged culture-negative peritonitis, chylous ascites, and elevated ascitic ADA may hint the possibility of mycobacterial infections. Diagnostic method allowing prompt identification of the pathogen is warranted. The prognosis can be extremely poor, and the prophylaxis and treatment should be better defined. TEXT: pmcBackground Mycobacteria avium (M. avium) is a species of slowly growing nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). M. avium, M intracellulare, and an increasing number of newly identified species comprise M. avium complex (MAC). Most laboratories are unable to differentiate the exact species because of lack of molecular methods required. MAC is widespread in the environment, and can be an opportunistic pathogen [1]. Immunodeficient patients are predisposed to MAC infections, particularly those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) [2]. Lung disease is the most common form of MAC infections, accounting for 80% of NTM-related pulmonary disease. MAC can also invade the lymph nodes, bones, joints, skin, and soft tissue to cause extrapulmonary infections, and can spread systemically, resulting into disseminated infections [1].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597043.0361593}
