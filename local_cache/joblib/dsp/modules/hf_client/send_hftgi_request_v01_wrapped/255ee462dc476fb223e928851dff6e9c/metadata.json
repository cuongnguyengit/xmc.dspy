ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) associated with the use of first-generation antipsychotics is a widely known phenomenon. This idiosyncratic reaction is less significant with the use of second-generation antipsychotics, and only a few cases in the literature exist, describing this reaction with clozapine use. While being titrated on clozapine, the patient developed major and minor criteria features of NMS as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth edition (DSM-5) criteria except for fever, a core symptom which created diagnostic uncertainty. Initially, clozapine was temporarily discontinued due to his deteriorating mental and physical state. A rechallenge was considered at a much lower dose, but due to a rapid increase in his creatinine kinase (CK) levels within a 12-hour timeframe, clozapine was permanently stopped. The evidence further suggests that the presentation of NMS for patients on this medication may be different to the classical presentation, and other criteria for diagnosis are suggested, which may lower the threshold for investigating NMS for patients on clozapine. TEXT: 1. Introduction There are extremely few reported cases of clozapine associated NMS without fever. The diagnosis of NMS as per the DSM-5 criteria is made when a there is evidence of exposure to a dopamine antagonist, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and at least 2 of diaphoresis, tremor, altered level of consciousness, labile BP, tachycardia, elevated CK, or leucocytosis. A case review in 2015 revealed that tachycardia, tachypnoea, blood pressure lability, and other autonomic symptoms were frequent and severe, possibly related to the high affinity of clozapine for adrenergic and muscarinic receptors. It was also noted that extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and fever were less reported symptoms for patients on clozapine [1]. If the DSM-5 criteria were applied to this patient, he would not have met the threshold for diagnosis of NMS due to the absence of fever on repeated measurements. 2. Patient Information The patient is a 44-year-old male well known to mental health services with an established diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. An emergency admission to an inpatient psychiatric unit was warranted following concerns by community teams with regard to a deterioration in his mental health secondary to poor compliance with oral antipsychotic medication. As a result of his psychotic symptoms not controlled on various oral and injectable antipsychotics such as olanzapine, risperidone, and paliperidone, the multidisciplinary team (MDT) decided to commence him on clozapine. This gentleman was not on any regular medications and was otherwise fit and healthy. His cardiac health, long-term blood sugar control, and body mass index (BMI) were all within normal ranges. 3.
