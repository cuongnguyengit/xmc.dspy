ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: By July 2021, the United States had over 34.4 million confirmed COVID-19 cases. Various cardiovascular manifestations of COVID-19 have been reported including ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and there is concern that SARS-CoV-2 may be associated with a higher thrombus burden. We performed a retrospective chart review of 535 adult patients with COVID-19 admitted at Yale-New Haven Health Greenwich Hospital from February 1, 2020, to May 13, 2020. All admitted patients had undergone testing for serum troponin I and various inflammatory markers, and we identified three patients who were diagnosed with acute STEMI. Data was collected via manual chart review and included patient demographics, comorbidities, laboratory tests, electrocardiogram (ECG) results, echocardiography results, diagnoses during hospitalization, inpatient therapies, and outcomes including length of hospital stay, revascularization results, and mortality. Three of our patients had obstructive coronary artery disease confirmed via angiography. One subject was noted to display vasospasm in addition to coronary atherosclerotic obstruction and refractory thrombus formation. Among our patients with COVID-19 and STEMI, presentations were variable in terms of timing of onset of ECG changes, age, gender, race, comorbidities, symptomology, and outcomes. TEXT: 1. Introduction As of July 2021, the United States has over 34.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [1]. SARS-CoV-2 infection has variable manifestations in humans, and there are reported cases of patients with COVID-19 presenting with a broad spectrum of cardiovascular manifestations including acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, myopericarditis mimicking ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), ischemic and stress-induced cardiomyopathy, coronary vasospasm, and pericardial effusion [2\u20134]. 2. Case Presentation We performed a single-center retrospective chart review of 535 adult patients with COVID-19 admitted to our suburban community hospital, Yale-New Haven Health Greenwich Hospital, from February 1, 2020, to May 13, 2020, and we identified three cases of acute STEMI who underwent coronary angiography. These patients diagnosed with COVID-19 had a positive result on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of a nasopharyngeal sample. After being granted Institutional Review Board approval, subjects were identified by requesting access to a list of all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 from our Infection Control department. 3.
