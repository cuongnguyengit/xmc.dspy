ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are generally safe and well-tolerated drugs that are extensively used for the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. Muscle and liver adverse reactions are the best recognized, while cutaneous side effects are exceedingly rare. We present the case of a 65-year-old woman with severe hypercholesterolemia, who developed generalized erythematous cutaneous lesions with pruritus, resembling lichen planus, months after starting treatment with simvastatin. The symptoms disappeared on withdrawal of simvastatin and reappeared within 3 months upon rechallenge with rosuvastatin. In addition to describing a rare adverse effect of statins, the authors also discuss the nutraceutical approach to the management of a statin-intolerant patient. Lichenoid drug eruption is an uncommon cutaneous adverse effect of several drugs, with very few cases associated with statins.A temporal relationship, dechallenge/rechallenge information, and the lack of confounding factors or alternative explanations support the suggestion of causality.Due to the lack of optimized alternative treatment options for statin-intolerant patients, the nutraceutical approach should be considered. TEXT: INTRODUCTION 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (HMGCRi, statins) are frequently prescribed pharmaceutical products. Statins are the mainstay of the management of elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in patients with high cardiovascular (CV) risk. HMGCRi are well tolerated with a good safety profile[1]. The most commonly reported side effects of statins are myotoxicity and hepatotoxicity[1]. Statins have also been associated with a number of cutaneous conditions (e.g. eczematous skin rash, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, porphyria cutanea tarda, bullous dermatosis, UV-B phototoxicity, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, cheilitis, photosensitivity and dermatomyositis-like syndrome)[2]. Lichenoid drug eruption caused by HMGCRi is exceptional[1]. We describe a lichenoid eruption linked to simvastatin and rosuvastatin and a proposed alternative regimen to reduce total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C in a patient with a severe hypercholesterolemia phenotype. CASE REPORT A 65-year-old woman presented with symmetric eruption of flat-topped, erythematous papules on the trunk and extremities (forearms and legs), with pruritus. Some of the lesions manifested with a central pustule and marked desquamation, resembling lichen planus. Psoriasiform dermatitis on the palmar surfaces (Fig. 1) and involvement of the lateral border of the tongue was also observed. The patient mentioned similar but milder earlier episodes of cutaneous eruptions in the previous 2 years.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596085.510317}
