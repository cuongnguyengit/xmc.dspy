ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Endoscopic shielding using oxidized regenerated cellulose after argon plasma coagulation under mandatory dual antiplatelet therapy. ABSTRACT: Endoscopic shielding is an innovative concept in therapeutic endoscopy. Its usage has been mostly restricted to wide-field endoscopic mucosal resection and/or endoscopic submucosal dissection. A novel potential clinical use may be in bleeding pophylaxis for argon plasma coagulation-related ulcers under concomitant mandatory dual antiplatelet therapy. TEXT: While in broad clinical use in many fields of surgery, endoscopic shielding is considered quite a novel concept in interventional endoscopy, for example, for large postresectional lesions [endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and/or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)], with available data indicating prevention of late perforation and/or bleeding as well as accelerated tissue repair/healing.1 Apart from polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets, another biocompatible, naturally absorbable hemostatic substance for endoscopic applications is oxidized regenerated cellulose, which is less expensive and more broadly available.2 Apart from endoscopic shielding for endoscopic resection procedures, there is an ever\u2010increasing set of clinical applications in interventional endoscopy reported, including perforation and/or fistula closure, difficult\u2010to\u2010treat bleeding situations, and\u2014among others\u2014stricture prevention following esophageal ESD procedures.3, 4, 5 However, argon plasma coagulation (APC), for which endoscopic shielding has not yet been reported, is by itself considered a low\u2010risk procedure in terms of bleeding in recent guidelines, however, clinical caution is mandatory in the presence of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Delayed bleeding and/or perforation after APC application, especially in the cecal pole, may occur and may have deleterious consequences in patients with recent coronary stent interventions. From such reasoning, here, the first report on preventive endoscopic shielding of an APC site in such a complex clinical setting is presented. Of note, mandatory DAPT indications are becoming more and more common in increasingly aging populations with a high comorbidity of advanced cardiovascular disease and colorectal angiodysplasia.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596083.4690437}
