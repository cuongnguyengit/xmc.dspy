ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Unilateral abdominal wall clonic seizures are a rare manifestation of epilepsy. We report three cases of focal aware seizures manifesting as unilateral abdominal clonic motor movements. Standard EEG for patients with focal motor abdominal seizures is often unrevealing, which can make the diagnosis difficult. We report the first case of intracranial EEG in the diagnosis of a patients with this type of semiology during a focal seizure. In the absence of an electroclinical seizure verified by video-EEG monitoring, caution should be made with the diagnosis. A careful history should be obtained to help differentiate between unilateral abdominal clonic jerking and other abdominal complaints. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Seizures presenting as unilateral abdominal wall clonic jerking have been reported infrequently in the literature. There are 20 cases published in the English literature, the majority of which were an expression of epilepsia partialis continua [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15] (See Table 1).Table 1 Review of prior cases of abdominal motor seizures in the English literature.
