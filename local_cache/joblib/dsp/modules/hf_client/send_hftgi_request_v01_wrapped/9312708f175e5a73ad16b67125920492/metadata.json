ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: Endoscopic shielding is an innovative concept in therapeutic endoscopy. Its usage has been mostly restricted to wide-field endoscopic mucosal resection and/or endoscopic submucosal dissection. A novel potential clinical use may be in bleeding pophylaxis for argon plasma coagulation-related ulcers under concomitant mandatory dual antiplatelet therapy. TEXT: While in broad clinical use in many fields of surgery, endoscopic shielding is considered quite a novel concept in interventional endoscopy, for example, for large postresectional lesions [endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and/or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)], with available data indicating prevention of late perforation and/or bleeding as well as accelerated tissue repair/healing.1 Apart from polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets, another biocompatible, naturally absorbable hemostatic substance for endoscopic applications is oxidized regenerated cellulose, which is less expensive and more broadly available.2 Apart from endoscopic shielding for endoscopic resection procedures, there is an ever\u2010increasing set of clinical applications in interventional endoscopy reported, including perforation and/or fistula closure, difficult\u2010to\u2010treat bleeding situations, and\u2014among others\u2014stricture prevention following esophageal ESD procedures.3, 4, 5 However, argon plasma coagulation (APC), for which endoscopic shielding has not yet been reported, is by itself considered a low\u2010risk procedure in terms of bleeding in recent guidelines, however, clinical caution is mandatory in the presence of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Delayed bleeding and/or perforation after APC application, especially in the cecal pole, may occur and may have deleterious consequences in patients with recent coronary stent interventions. From such reasoning, here, the first report on preventive endoscopic shielding of an APC site in such a complex clinical setting is presented. Of note, mandatory DAPT indications are becoming more and more common in increasingly aging populations with a high comorbidity of advanced cardiovascular disease and colorectal angiodysplasia.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596609.6077497}
