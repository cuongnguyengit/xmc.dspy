ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: A 32-week premature infant presented with respiratory failure, later progressing to pulmonary hypertension (PH), liver failure, lactic acidosis, and encephalopathy. Using exome sequencing, this patient was diagnosed with a rare Polymerase Gamma (POLG)-related mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion syndrome. This case demonstrates that expanding the differential to uncommon diagnoses is important for complex infants, even in premature neonates whose condition may be explained partially by their gestational age (GA). It also shows that patients with complex neonatal diseases with significant family history may benefit from exome sequencing for diagnosis. TEXT: Introduction Human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is circular double stranded DNA that encodes the respiratory chain proteins and associated RNA apparatus, which is involved in maintenance and translation of respiratory chain proteins. Maintenance of the mtDNA relies on transcription and translation of nuclear genes. These nuclear genes facilitate mitochondrial nucleotide synthesis or mtDNA replication. mtDNA depletion disorders (OMIM #PS603041) are a heterogeneous group of mostly autosomal recessive diseases classified by a profound reduction in mtDNA copy number from defects of either of these two mechanisms. Depletion of mtDNA causes a variable degree of energy failure with four main clinical presentations, all of which can begin in infancy. Myopathic disease results from a defect in the mitochondrial isoform of thymidine kinase. This condition presents with feeding difficulty, failure to thrive, hypotonia, motor regression, and early death. Hepatocerebral disease results from a defect in DGUOK, Polymerase Gamma (POLG), or MPV17 and presents with persistent vomiting, failure to thrive, lactic acidosis, hypotonia, liver dysfunction, and encephalopathy. Encephalomyopathic disease results from a defect in the beta subunit of ADP-forming succinyl CoA synthase and is characterized by dystonia, hypotonia, hearing impairment, and epilepsy. Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy syndrome (MNGIE) is caused by mutations in TYMP and presents with predominantly GI symptoms. First discovered in 2001, POLG-related disorders are a subset of mtDNA depletion disorders with a defect in the catalytic subunit of the mtDNA polymerase, one of the three essential factors required for mtDNA replication. These disorders cause progressive accumulation of errors in, or depletion of, mtDNA, leading to an oxidative phosphorylation defect. The POLG gene has greater than 200 mutations distributed across three domains (polymerase, exonuclease, and linker) that lead to clinical disease. Carrier frequency of these mutations is high in the western world, ~1/100 in North America (Hakonen et al., 2007; Wong et al., 2008; Stumpf et al., 2013).\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597153.4836795}
