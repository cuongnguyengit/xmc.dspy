ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Hiccups are sudden, repeated, and involuntary contractions of the diaphragm muscle (myoclonic contraction). It involves a reflex arc that, once activated, causes a strong contraction of the diaphragm immediately followed by the closure of the glottis translating into the classic \"hic\" sound. Hiccups can be short, persistent, and intractable depending on the duration. The most disabling hiccups often represent the epiphenomenon of a medical condition such as gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders; central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities; ear, nose, and throat (ENT) conditions or pneumological problems; metabolic/endocrine disorders; infections; and psychogenic disorders. Some drugs, such as aripiprazole, a second-generation antipsychotic, can induce the onset of variable hiccups. We describe herein the cases of three hospitalized patients who developed insistent hiccups after taking aripiprazole and who positively responded to low doses of gabapentin. It is probable that aripiprazole, prescribed at a low dosage (<7.5 mg/day), would act as a dopamine agonist by stimulating D2 and D3 receptors at the \"hiccup center\" level-located in the brain stem-thus triggering the hiccup. On the other hand, gabapentin led to a complete regression of the hiccup probably by reducing the nerve impulse transmission and modulating the diaphragmatic activity. The present case series suggests the use of low doses of gabapentin as an effective treatment for aripiprazole-induced hiccups. However, our knowledge of the neurotransmitter functioning of the hiccup reflex arc is still limited, and further research is needed to characterize the neurotransmitters involved in hiccups for potential novel therapeutic targets. TEXT: 1. Introduction Hiccup is the sudden onset of erratic diaphragmatic and intercostal muscular myoclonus with early glottis closure terminating inspiration; hence, the abrupt air rush into lungs induces the vocal cords to close leading to a characteristic \u201chic\u201d sound [1\u20133]. Hiccup or \u201csingultus\u201d is a Latin-derived word that means \u201csob\u201d or \u201cgasp\u201d or rather indicates \u201cthe act of catching one\\'s breath while sobbing\u201d [4]. Hiccups are a common experience, representing generally a self-limited disorder that starts with no specific reason and disappears in a few minutes. Many episodes would subside spontaneously without any clinical significance and warrant treatment only when they become persistent and bothersome. If protracted, they can affect conversation, concentration, and oral intake, and they can lead to frustration, fatigue, and insomnia. Severe and prolonged hiccup may lead to exhaustion, fatigue, malnutrition, weight loss, dehydration, and even death in the extreme situations [5, 6].\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to', 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597070.07003}
