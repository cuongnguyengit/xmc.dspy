ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Many a times while treating dermatoses conventional therapies are either contraindicated or not effective. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a good alternative available to tide over crises. Over the last 15 years of my practice I have used IVIg in various severe or recalcitrant diseases (including TEN, autoimmune blistering disease,connective tissue disorders , chronic urticaria etc) which were either unresponsive to conventional modality of therapy or primary therapy could not be given because of co-morbidities. IVIg a sterile, highly purified preparation containing more than 95% unmodified IgG,was first approved by FDA in 1981 for 6 diseases. As mentioned above in many circumstances we reached a situation when either conventional primary therapy was contraindicated or patients were not responding. IVIg came to our rescue in large number of conditions to tide over the crisis and also created the environment leading to conventional therapy becoming effective. Very few minor side effects like low grade fever and myalgia were observed in very few cases. No serious or severe side effects were seen, however , one has to be prepared for anaphylactic reaction which is a theoretical possibility. It can be said that IVIg though not a magic drug, is a very effective tool available in the armamentarium of Dermatologists to treat plethora of chronic and intractable dermatoses. TEXT: Introduction Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is a sterile, highly purified, unmodified immunoglobulin G (IgG) preparation (95%) with only traces of IgG and IgM. This is made from pooled human plasma of approximately 3\u201310 thousand individual donors by cold ethanol fractionation.[1] IVIg was first licensed by FDA in 1981 and approved for use in six conditions: primary immunodeficiencies, Kawasaki syndrome, Immune thrombocytopenic purpura(ITP), recent bone marrow transplantation (in patients 20 years of age or older), chronic B-cell lymphocytic leukemia, and pediatric HIV type 1 infection. Besides above six conditions, use of IVIg has been well accepted in Graft-versus-host disease and dermatomyositis. Despite of high cost, it has been used in large number of dermatoses. Numerous case reports and series are available in literature of autoimmune blistering mucocutaneous diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), atopic dermatitis, chronic autoimmune urticaria, pyoderma gangrenosum, systemic sclerosis, necrotizing fasciitis, polymyositis, vasculitis, psoriasis, and infectious disorders (such as streptococcal toxic shock syndrome), etc.[123456] A consensus statement was published in 2003 on the use of IVIg in patients with autoimmune mucocutaneous blistering diseases.[78]\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597155.3690863}
