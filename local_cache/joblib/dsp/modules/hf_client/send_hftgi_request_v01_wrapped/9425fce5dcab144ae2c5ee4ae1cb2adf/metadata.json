ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Clozapine is an effective antipsychotic for the treatment of resistant schizophrenia. However, clozapine can lead to serious side effects. One of the most common side effects is constipation and in rare cases ileus, which is associated with a considerable case fatality rate. Our patient exhibited repeated episodes of ileus while being treated with clozapine. We adapted the treatment of the patient in several ways to manage these severe side effects. First, we reduced clozapine dosage by opting for an augmentation strategy of clozapine through paliperidone. Then, we added linaclotide as a nonconventional laxative. We further adapted treatment after the occurrence of a volvulus prompting surgical intervention which revealed a malformation of the intestines' peritoneal attachment. A gastrostomy to facilitate the treatment of any further episode was performed and bethanechol was introduced alongside linaclotide. Follow-up revealed the efficacy of our strategy involving the use of linaclotide in managing the side effects of clozapine in this patient. TEXT: pmc1. Introduction Clozapine is the first synthetised atypical antipsychotic [1] and is recommended for the treatment of resistant schizophrenia [2] but is linked to serious adverse effects like agranulocytosis, seizures, cardiovascular effects, or gastrointestinal effects [3]. Clozapine is the antipsychotic with the most potent anticholinergic effect [4], an effect that is dose-dependent [5], and precipitates constipation in 14% to 60% of patients [6, 7]. In some cases, treatment with clozapine has been linked to ileus. A Chinese population study on 7921 patients treated with clozapine found that 8 cases of ileus were reported [8]. Ileus is a serious side effect and leads to many fatalities, with Palmer establishing a 27% case fatality rate in a group of 102 patients who were exhibiting gastrointestinal side effects under clozapine treatment [9]. The onset of ileus occurs on average four years after starting clozapine, indicating that the side effect is more associated with the maintenance phase than the introductory period [10]. Due to the high fatality rate related to these side effects, clozapine is reserved for adults suffering from resistant schizophrenia as discussed by Kane et al., for whom no treatment alternatives can be found. Schizophrenia is classified as resistant when the patient has not adequately responded to two trials of different neuroleptics [1]. Here, we present a case report on the management of severe and resistant ileus in a patient treated with clozapine for resistant schizophrenia with different strategies, including the use of linaclotide. To our knowledge and at the time of writing of this paper, there are no case studies in the scientific literature on the use of linaclotide to counter clozapine-induced constipation [11]. 2.
