ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \u201cI think I\u2019m having a stroke.\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient. We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Hypokalemic paralysis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, thiazide diuretics, alcohol abuse, anxiety, hypertension\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Fanconi-Bickel syndrome in an infant with cytomegalovirus infection: A case report and review of the literature. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation of the SLC2A2 gene, which encodes glucose transporter protein 2 (GLUT2). METHODS We report a 7-mo-old girl with cytomegalovirus infection presenting hepatomegaly, jaundice, liver transaminase elevation, fasting hypoglycemia, hyperglycosuria, proteinuria, hypophosphatemia, rickets, and growth retardation. After prescription of ganciclovir, the levels of bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase decreased to normal, while she still had aggravating hepatomegaly and severe hyperglycosuria. Then, whole exome sequencing was conducted and revealed a homozygous c.416delC mutation in exon 4 of SLC2A2 inherited from her parents, which was predicted to change alanine 139 to valine (p.A139Vfs*3), indicating a diagnosis of FBS. During the follow-up, the entire laboratory test returned to normal with extra supplement of vitamin D and corn starch. Her weight increased to normal range at 3 years old without hepatomegaly. However, she still had short stature. Although there was heterogeneity between phenotype and genotype, Chinese children had typical clinical manifestations. No hot spot mutation or association between severity and mutations was found, but nonsense and missense mutations were more common. Data of long-term follow-up were rare, leading to insufficient assessment of the prognosis in Chinese children. CONCLUSIONS FBS is a rare genetic metabolic disease causing impaired glucose liver homeostasis and proximal renal tubular dysfunction. Results of urine and blood testing suggesting abnormal glucose metabolism could be the clues for FBS in neonates and infants. Genetic sequencing is indispensable for diagnosis. Since the diversity of disease severity, early identification and long-term follow-up could help improve patients' quality of life and decrease mortality.
