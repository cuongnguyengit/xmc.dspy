ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Epstein-Barr Virus Prevalence at Diagnosis and Seroconversion during Follow-Up in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease. ABSTRACT: Primary Epstein-Barr virus infection in pediatric patients with inflammatory bowel disease during immunomodulation with thiopurines has been associated with increased risk for malignancies or hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. We determined Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seroprevalence at inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) diagnosis and seroconversion during follow-up in a large single center cohort of children with IBD. EBV serology results and patient characteristics were retrospectively retrieved from the hospital documentation system. EBV seronegative patients at IBD diagnosis were prospectively retested. We report on IBD patients with symptomatic active EBV infection and a complicated disease course, and those diagnosed with malignancy with respect to EBV status and drug exposure. Of 402 patients, 194 (48%) had available EBV serology results at time of IBD diagnosis at a median of 12 years (IQR 9-14 years). Thereof, 102 (53%) were EBV-positive. Of 92 EBV-negative patients, 66 were retested and 17% showed a seroconversion at a mean follow-up time of 4.3 years (SD 3 years). Three children treated with azathioprine experienced acute clinically relevant EBV infection 2, 2.5, and 4 years after IBD diagnosis, two developed signs of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Three cases of malignancy occurred in the cohort, though none seemed to be triggered by EBV. In conclusion, almost 50% of pediatric IBD patients were EBV-na\u00efve following diagnosis and may be at increased risk to develop severe EBV infection during immunosuppressive therapy, potentially associated with complications such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or malignancy.
