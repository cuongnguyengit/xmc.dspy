ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \"found down\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \u201ccatch up\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient. We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Compartment syndrome, crush syndrome, sleep deprivation, zolpidem, diphenhydramine\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim induced liver failure: a case report. ABSTRACT: Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) is a commonly used antibiotic, its\\' known adverse reaction of hepatotoxicity leading to acute liver failure is considered rare. We present a case of a 22 year old female who developed jaundice and acute liver failure one week after taking SMX/TMP for a UTI. After an extensive work up, a clinical diagnosis of SMX/TMP induced liver failure was reached. Over the course of several weeks she made a good clinical and biochemical recovery with supportive care. In this case report we describe her clinical presentation and course, and present a brief review of the literature. TEXT: Introduction Sulfamethoxazole/Trimethoprim (SMX/TMP) is a commonly used antibiotic for respiratory, gastrointestinal and urinary tract infections caused by a range of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. It also has activity against Listeria monocytogenes, Nocardia and Pneuomcystis jiroveci. SMX/TMP is generally well tolerated in non-HIV-infected patients in whom adverse reactions occur in approximately 6 to 8 percent of individuals. In comparison, the adverse reaction rate is as high as 25 to 50 percent in HIV-infected patients, with many of the reactions being severe. The most common adverse reactions include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dermatological reactions such as pruritis, urticaria and less commonly Steven Johnson Syndrome. Life-threatening adverse reactions include neutropenia, exfoliative dermatitis (a severe skin disorder with generalized erythema and scaling) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (an acute severe reaction with widespread erythema and detachment of the epidermis). Acute liver failure has only been reported in a few cases worldwide, and has been attributed to the sulphonamide component of the drug.
