ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Pneumonitis is a potential consequence of both lung-directed radiation and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), particularly treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Significant morbidity and mortality can result, and severe pneumonitis attributed to ICB precludes continued therapy. Thus, discriminating between radiation- and ICB- related pneumonitis is of importance for the increasing number of patients receiving both treatments. Furthermore, data are limited regarding the interplay between radiation- and ICB-induced lung injury, and which biomarkers might be associated with toxicity. We report longitudinal clinical and radiologic data, and circulating biomarkers in a melanoma patient treated with axillary radiation followed by ICB who developed consolidation and ground glass opacities (GGO) within the radiation field suggestive of radiation-pneumonitis followed by consolidation outside of the radiation field suggestive of ICB-related pneumonitis. Of note, symptomatic radiation-pneumonitis developed despite a low radiation dose to the lung (V20 < 8%), and ICB-related pneumonitis was limited to the ipsilateral lung, suggesting additive effect of radiation and ICB in the development of lung injury. Circulating biomarker analyses demonstrated increases in CXCR2, IL1ra and IL2ra that coincided with the development of symptomatic pneumonitis. These data highlight the imaging findings associated with radiation and ICB-related lung toxicity, and anecdotally describe a clinical course with circulating biomarker correlates. This information can help guide clinical evaluation and future research investigations into the toxicity of combined radiation immunotherapy approaches. TEXT: Background Pneumonitis develops in less than 5% of patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor ICB monotherapy. [1, 2] Many cases are relatively mild, and patients can resume ICB therapy following steroid treatment and resolution of symptoms. However, < 1% of cases are more severe [1], and patients can require prolonged treatment, require hospitalization, and be precluded from additional ICB treatment, even if this therapy is otherwise providing clinical benefit. In addition to ICB, radiation therapy to the lung can also lead to an inflammatory pneumonitis generally treated with a lengthy course of corticosteroids in more severe cases. Rates of radiation pneumonitis vary significantly based on the amount of lung irradiated, as well as the dose of radiation that is delivered [3]. For example, in lung cancer patients, rates of grade 2 or higher pneumonitis were found to be 0% when the volume of the lung receiving 20 Gray (Gy) or higher was less than 22%, as compared to a 42% risk if the volume receiving 20 Gy or higher was greater than 40%.
