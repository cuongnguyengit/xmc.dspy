ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Chemoradiation with capecitabine followed by surgery is standard care for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). Severe diarrhea is considered a dose-limiting toxicity of adding capecitabine to radiation therapy. The aim of this study was to describe the risk factors and the impact of body composition on severe diarrhea in patients with LARC during preoperative chemoradiation with capecitabine. METHODS A single centre retrospective cohort study was conducted in a tertiary referral centre. All patients treated with preoperative chemoradiation with capecitabine for LARC from 2009 to 2015 were included. Patients with locally recurrent rectal cancer who received chemoradiation for the first time were included as well. Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for severe diarrhea. RESULTS A total of 746 patients were included. Median age was 64 years (interquartile range 57-71) and 477 patients (64%) were male. All patients received a radiation dosage of 25 \u00d7 2 Gy during a period of five weeks with either concomitant capecitabine administered on radiation days or continuously during radiotherapy. In this cohort 70 patients (9%) developed severe diarrhea. In multivariable logistic regression analyses female sex (OR: 4.42, 95% CI 2.54-7.91) and age \u2265 65 (OR: 3.25, 95% CI 1.85-5.87) were the only risk factors for severe diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS Female patients and patients aged sixty-five or older had an increased risk of developing severe diarrhea during preoperative chemoradiation therapy with capecitabine. No relation was found between body composition and severe diarrhea. TEXT: Background With approximately 4.500 of newly diagnosed cases per year in the Netherlands alone, rectal cancer is a common malignancy for both male and female [1]. Management of rectal cancer has rapidly changed due to the advent of new multimodality treatment modalities and has led to major improvements in oncologic outcomes [2\u20134]. The golden standard for curative treatment of rectal cancer still consists of surgical resection. Herein, a radical resection ought to be achieved, as a circumferential resection margin (CRM) of \u2264 1 mm increases the risk of local recurrence [5, 6]. To improve the chance of a clear CRM, preoperative radiation therapy as neoadjuvant treatment is standard of care in patients with a high risk for local recurrence, including patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) [4]. The addition of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to long course radiation therapy has shown to increase response rates [7, 8]. Disadvantages of continuous 5-FU infusion are the need of hospitalisation and complications related to central venous infusion. Both can lead to unwanted costs and a delay to surgery [8].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597113.489919}
