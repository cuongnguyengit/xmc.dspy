ABSTRACT: Conventional skeletal chondrosarcoma is a bone neoplasm, which is poorly sensitive to anthracyclines-based chemotherapy. We report on an 18-month-long tumour response to gemcitabine as single agent in a young patient with an advanced secondary peripheral conventional chondrosarcoma, previously treated unsuccessfully with anthracyclines, ifosfamide, platinum, etoposide. TEXT: Background The skeletal chondrosarcoma family represents a heterogeneous group of malignant bone mesenchymal tumours characterised by the production of a chondroid matrix. They are the third bone sarcoma in incidence, and the most frequent in adults. There are three main subtypes: conventional, mesenchymal, and clear-cell. A \u201cdedifferentiated\u201d chondrosarcoma develops in 10-15% of conventional chondrosarcomas, while mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a high-grade, aggressive neoplasm with a natural history and chemosensitivity that might be close to Ewing sarcoma, and clear-cell chondrosarcoma is a low-grade variant [1]. In conventional chondrosarcoma (cCS), the histological malignancy grade is the main prognostic factor [2]. Grade 1 cCS are characterised by a very low metastatic potential, and some authors have quite recently suggested a re-classification of these types as \u201catypical cartilaginous tumours\u201d [1]. Grade 2 and 3 cCS are marked by a higher metastatic potential, with a 10-year survival of 64-86% and 29-55% respectively [3,4]. CCSs are also categorised according to their location in the bone: a central chondrosarcoma onsets in the medullary cavity, a small percentage of them from a pre-existing benign lesion known as enchondroma, while a peripheral variant arises from the surface of the bone, as a result of malignant progression of a pre-existing benign (solitary or hereditary) osteochondroma. Surgery is the mainstay of the treatment of localized disease. While curettage is acceptable for grade 1 cCS, wide excision is usually required for higher grade cCS, with the exception of skull base cCS which may be treated with radiotherapy. In particular, hadrons can play an important role in the management of skull base cCS, and very good outcomes are reported [5].\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon and life-threating condition characterized by major immune activation and massive cytokine production by mononuclear inflammatory cells, due to defects in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. It is even more unusual in renal transplant recipients, in which it is often associated with uncontrolled infection. The mortality is high in HLH and differential diagnosis with sepsis is a challenge. The approach and management depend on the underlying trigger and comorbidities. We report a case of a 50-year-old renal transplant female admitted with fever and malaise 3 months post-transplant and presenting anemia, fever, hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of serum ferritin, and positive CMV antigenemia. Urine was positive for decoy cells and BKV-DNA. Graft biopsy showed CMV nephritis. Both blood and urine cultures where positive for E. coli. Hemophagocytosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone, with complete response after 3 weeks. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of a rare and serious condition in a renal transplant patient, which can allow a favorable clinical course and improve survival rate. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) consists of an immune hyperactivation syndrome that takes place when NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to eliminate activated macrophages, leading to over production of proinflammatory cytokines1. There are primary and acquired causes. Primary HLH is rare and typically manifests in childhood because of two autosomal recessive defects in genes that encode proteins involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules during apoptosis in natural killer (NK) cells.1 , 2Acquired (secondary) HLH is triggered by various conditions as infections, immunodeficiency, rheumatologic diseases, and cancer.1 , 3 , 4 Infection is the most common precipitating factor of HLH in adults, mainly viruses of herpes family (EBV, CMV, HSV, HHV8), but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens can also be a trigger.5 , 6 Multiorgan involvement and organomegaly are frequently found and hemophagocytosis results in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of HLH is based on the presence of at least 5 of the following 8 criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting \u2265 2 lineages of peripheral blood cells), hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, serum ferritin >500 ng/mL, low activity of NK cells, soluble CD25 > 2.400 U/mL and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes.7 Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red cells, platelets, or white cells in macrophage cytoplasm visualized in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.2 The syndrome is defined by a complex picture. However, some patients may have incipient or partial disease.1 Most diagnostic\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to identify the adverse drug reactions affecting the patient.

ABSTRACT: Intravenous immunoglobulin is a recognized treatment in recalcitrant autoimmune bullous diseases. Infusions are administered monthly over 1-5 days in the hospital setting and associated with mild to severe infusion-related systemic effects, in part due to the high doses necessary to induce and achieve remission. We present a case series of four patients with bullous diseases treated successfully with low-dose subcutaneous IgG who achieved remission with maintenance therapy. Patient-administered smaller, more frequent doses of IgG into subcutaneous tissue more closely mimics the body's own antibody production and produces a more stable serum trough level. Subcutaneous IgG is a novel treatment approach in bullous diseases which can induce a state remission. TEXT: Introduction Autoimmune bullous diseases are characterized by bullous lesions to the skin and mucous membranes of the oral cavity, nose, eyes, larynx, pharynx, esophagus, and genitals.1 Once considered fatal conditions, treatment options have evolved from corticosteroids to steroid-sparing immunosuppressant drugs (methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine and mycophenolic acid (MMF)), monoclonal antibodies (rituximab), and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).2\u20134 IVIG is a human plasma derivative containing IgG and has been used in conjunction with conventional therapy to treat refractory bullous diseases.2,4 Subcutaneous IgG (SCIG) is an effective alternative for patients refractory to or unable to tolerate immunosuppressive therapy.4 Moreover, it has been shown to be more cost-effective than immunosuppressives, which can result in significant toxicities requiring hospitalization.5 The immunomodulatory effects are complex and multifaceted, including increased catabolism of autoantibodies, inhibition in autoantibody function, and decrease in plasma inflammatory markers.2,3,6 Optimal dosing varies but follows similar conventional weight-based approaches (300\u2013400 mg/kg/month) as well as higher doses (2 g/kg over 2\u20135 days/month) in aggressive disease.2,4,7 Adverse events can be mild (headaches, backaches, hives), severe (anaphylaxis, thromboembolism), and are usually infusion-related and self-limiting. However, adverse events increase with higher doses and may interfere with patient\u2019s quality of life.3,6 The goal of therapy in the bullous diseases is to induce and maintain remission, as evidenced by the cessation of new vesicle and bullae formation and healing of old lesions.3,8 Long-term therapy may be required in recalcitrant disease and may be associated with significant toxicities if corticosteroids or immunosuppressants are needed, particularly in elderly patients with bullous pemphigoid.8 In the present case series, we describe the use of low-dose SCIG (Hizentra; CSL Behring Inc) to safely induce and maintain long-term remissions in four patients\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706596344.7645938}
