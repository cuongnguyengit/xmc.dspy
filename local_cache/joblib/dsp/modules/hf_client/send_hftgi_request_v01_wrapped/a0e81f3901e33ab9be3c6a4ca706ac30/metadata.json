ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We will first identify the patients mentioned in the article, then look for any treatments or medications they received, and finally determine if there were any adverse reactions reported.\\nReactions: Fungal infection, Pneumocystis spp. infection, mucormycosis infection, diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, high-dose steroids, immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, bacterial infection\\n\\n---\\n\\nArticle: TITLE: RNA Sequencing for Personalized Treatment of Metastatic Leiomyosarcoma: Case Report. ABSTRACT: Uterine leiomyosarcoma (UL) is a rare malignant tumor that develops from the uterine smooth muscle tissue. Due to the low frequency and lack of sufficient data from clinical trials there is currently no effective treatment that is routinely accepted for UL. Here we report a case of a 65-years-old female patient with metastatic UL, who progressed on ifosfamide and doxorubicin therapy and developed severe hypertensive crisis after administration of second line pazopanib, which lead to treatment termination. Rapid progression of the tumor stressed the need for the alternative treatment options. We performed RNA sequencing and whole exome sequencing profiling of the patient's biopsy and applied Oncobox bioinformatic algorithm to prioritize targeted therapeutics. No clinically relevant mutations associated with drug efficiencies were found, but the Oncobox transcriptome analysis predicted regorafenib as the most effective targeted treatment option. Regorafenib administration resulted in a complete metabolic response which lasted for 10 months. In addition, RNA sequencing analysis revealed a novel cancer fusion transcript of YWHAE gene with fusion partner JAZF1. Several chimeric transcripts for YWHAE and JAZF1 genes were previously found in uterine neoplasms and some of them were associated with tumor prognosis. However, their combination was detected in this study for the first time. Taken together, these findings evidence that RNA sequencing may complement analysis of clinically relevant mutations and enhance management of oncological patients by suggesting putative treatment options. TEXT: pmcBackground Uterine leiomyosarcoma (UL) is the most common type of uterine sarcomas which accounts for about 1-2% of uterine malignancies (1, 2). This tumor has a higher rate of metastasis without prior lymph node involvement compared to adenocarcinomas (2). Most patients experience vaginal bleeding, as well as in cases of patients with adenocarcinomas. Other patients may experience local discomfort from uterine enlargement. The average age of UL diagnosis is about 50 years (3). But in the early stages, the disease course is usually asymptomatic and is often mistakenly diagnosed as uterine leiomyoma (3). Approximately 0.5% of patients undergoing a hysterectomy for a suspected benign leiomyoma then demonstrate UL, and it is problematic to distinguish between the two tumors before surgery (2). Moreover, since laparoscopic extraction, including morcellation, there is a risk of spreading latent UL to the entire abdominal cavity (2).\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'parameters': {'do_sample': False, 'best_of': 1, 'details': False, 'temperature': 0.1, 'max_new_tokens': 150, 'top_p': 0.97, 'num_return_sequences': 1, 'stop': ('\\n\\n',)}}}"}, "time": 1706597110.5365646}
