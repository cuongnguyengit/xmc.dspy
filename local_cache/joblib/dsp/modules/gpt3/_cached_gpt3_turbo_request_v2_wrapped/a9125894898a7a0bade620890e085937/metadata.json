ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Androgens given for gender affirmation have been implicated in the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in transgender patients. 10 cases of transgender adults with IIH have been published but this association has not been described in younger patients. Herein we describe the first case of IIH in an adolescent transgender patient. A 17-year-old non-obese female-to-male transgender patient on subcutaneous testosterone since age 13 presented with a two-month history of transient visual obscuration and frontal headaches. Ophthalmological examination revealed Frisen grade 2 papilledema with preserved visual function. Lumbar puncture confirmed elevated opening pressure. Papilledema resolved with oral acetazolamide and reduction of testosterone therapy. The use of cross-sex hormone therapy (CSH) for gender affirmation may increase the risk of IIH. Awareness of this association is important as the number of younger transgender patients seeking CSH is increasing significantly. TEXT: pmc1 Introduction Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in adults is strongly associated with obesity and its incidence is four times higher in women than in men, at 7.7 versus 1.6 per 100,000, respectively.1 The etiology of IIH is unknown and likely multifactorial. Even though the role of sex hormones in the pathophysiology of IIH is not completely understood, androgen excess in women is associated with IIH.2 Specifically, women with IIH have increased serum testosterone and increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testosterone and androstenedione. This pattern of androgen excess differs from the one seen in isolated obesity or obesity related to polycystic ovary syndrome, which shares many features with IIH,3 suggesting that androgen excess may be an independent risk factor for IIH. Cross-sex hormone therapy (CSH), estrogen for transgender women and testosterone for transgender men, is used for gender affirmation. IIH has been reported in at least 16 adult transgender patients treated with CSH (Table 1),4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 whereas no cases have been reported in younger patients. Herein we describe the case of an adolescent who developed IIH while being treated with testosterone for a female-to-male (FTM) transition.Table 1 Reported cases in the literature of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in transgender patients.
