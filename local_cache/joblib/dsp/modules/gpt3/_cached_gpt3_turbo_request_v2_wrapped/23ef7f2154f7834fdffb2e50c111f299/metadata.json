It also mentions that \\\\\"some of our best fundraisers only speak English,\\\\\" which suggests that the ability to understand and likely speak English is important for the role. The role is for fundraisers, so skills related to fundraising activities are relevant. However, the snippet does not provide enough information to determine if the role involves managing fundraising activities, developing campaigns, or other specific tasks, so we will focus on the general skill of performing fundraising activities and the language skill mentioned.\\\\n\\\\nSkills:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706652789.7180045}
