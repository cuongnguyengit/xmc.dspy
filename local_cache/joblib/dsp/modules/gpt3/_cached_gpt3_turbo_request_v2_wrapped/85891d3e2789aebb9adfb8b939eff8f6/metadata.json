ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Schizophrenia is a chronic relapsing and remitting disorder associated with significant impairments in social and vocational functioning and a shortened lifespan, and it is a disabling psychiatric brain syndrome whose phenotype is characterized by three core symptom domains: positive symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, negative symptoms, which include lack of motivation and social withdrawal, and cognitive impairment. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia have severe problems with personal and social relations which affect their quality of life. Antipsychotic medications in conjunction with psychosocial interventions can help patients achieve recovery. Here are described three clinical cases of schizophrenic patients treated with cariprazine for inadequate response to a previous treatment. The purpose of this clinical series is to give useful information for the use of cariprazine in clinical practice. TEXT: Introduction Schizophrenia is a severe, chronic mental condition that requires long-term treatment.1 It is a heterogeneous mental disorder, with no single pathognomonic symptom or presentation, characterized by a constellation of signs and symptoms that are divided into three core symptom domains: positive, negative, and cognitive. Pharmacologic therapy is a central part of schizophrenia management and antipsychotics are the first-line medication for this psychiatric disorder. Cariprazine is a new D3/D2 partial agonist antipsychotic with preferential binding to D3 receptors2,3 (Table 1) and its efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia has been demonstrated by several trials.4\\\\u201311 Due to its specific profile, cariprazine is expected to predominately control negative symptoms, but its long-term efficacy in the prevention of disease relapse has been demonstrated as well.8 Common side effects include motor symptoms, restlessness and GI symptoms, albeit it is generally considered to be well tolerated. As of today, the number of novel treatments targeting schizophrenia is increasing.12 Cariprazine has the potential to be of additional value, thanks to its unique receptor profile and its good tolerability. Its beneficial effects have recently also been reported outside of schizophrenia.13Table 1 Binding Affinities of Cariprazine and the Clinical Properties of the Receptors.
