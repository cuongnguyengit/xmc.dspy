ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Rectus sheath haematoma (RSH) is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain. Despite being previously viewed as a benign, self-limiting condition, there is increasing evidence suggesting significant local and systemic complications with RSH. We present a case of an 82-year-old female who developed a large RSH following prescription of therapeutic anticoagulation for her new onset atrial fibrillation. She subsequently developed significant haemodynamic collapse, which necessitated emergency radiological intervention. We describe a novel approach to prevent recurrence of bleeding by inserting a covered endovascular stent across the origin of inferior epigastric artery. We also describe a rare finding of bladder perforation, presumed secondary to pressure necrosis from the haematoma. Our report contributes to the growing evidence which suggests RSH, particularly secondary to anticoagulation in the elderly, can result in catastrophic complications. In addition, bladder perforation is a rare but possible complication that needs to be considered. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Rectus sheath haematoma (RSH) is an unusual cause of abdominal pain and frequently viewed as a benign, self-limiting condition [1]. However, there is growing evidence to suggest that RSH can result in significant life threatening complications. We present a case of RSH in an elderly patient that resulted in life threatening haemodynamic instability and bladder perforation, a rarely reported complication. CASE REPORT A previously well 82-year-old female was referred for surgical opinion with worsening abdominal pain and loose bowel motions, after being anticoagulated (enoxaparin 90 mg twice daily) for 6 days under the medical team with new onset atrial fibrillation secondary to lower leg cellulitis. Relevant background includes hypertension and type two diabetes. Within 5 h of initial review, patient developed sudden haemodynamic collapse (systolic pressure 86 mm Hg, haemoglobin decreased from 114 g/L to 84 g/L and lactate raised to 13.5 mmol/L). Urgent computed topography showed a large right RSH measuring 151 \\\\u00d7 137 \\\\u00d7 128 mm extending into space of Retzius without contrast extravasation (Fig. 1). Due to concerns for active bleeding, an emergency radiological intervention by vascular team was arranged.
