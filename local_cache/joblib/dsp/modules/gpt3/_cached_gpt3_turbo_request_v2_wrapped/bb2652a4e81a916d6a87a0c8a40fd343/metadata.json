ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Symptomatic renal papillary varicosities and medullary nephrocalcinosis. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Nephrocalcinosis is often asymptomatic but can manifest with renal colic or hematuria. There is no reported association between nephrocalcinosis and renal vascular malformations, which may also be a source of hematuria. We herein present a case of a patient with hematuria related to nephrocalcinosis and renal papillary varicosities. These varicosities were diagnosed and successfully treated with flexible ureteroscopy and laser fulguration. METHODS A 24-year-old female with a history of epilepsy (on zonisamide), recent uncomplicated pregnancy, and new diagnosis of nephrocalcinosis presented with right flank pain and intermittent gross hematuria. Imaging revealed intermittent right sided hydronephrosis. A cystoscopy identified hematuria from the right ureteral orifice. Diagnostic flexible ureteroscopy revealed numerous intrapapillary renal stones and varicose veins of several renal papillae. A 200 \\\\u03bcm holmium laser fiber was used to unroof these stones and fulgurate the varicosities with resolution of her symptoms for several months. She later presented with left-sided symptoms and underwent left ureteroscopy with similar findings and identical successful treatment. CONCLUSIONS Unilateral hematuria from discrete vascular lesions of the renal collecting system may be obscured by other benign co-existing conditions, such as nephrocalcinosis and nephrolithiasis. Although a simultaneous presentation is rare, flexible ureteroscopy with laser fulguration offers an ideal diagnostic and therapeutic modality for these concurrent conditions if symptoms arise. TEXT: pmcBackground Nephrocalcinosis describes a condition in which calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate deposition occurs within the renal parenchyma. It is often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on radiographic imaging. When symptoms do occur, they often include renal colic from associated nephrolithiasis or extrusion of calcium deposits into the collecting system, both of which can result in hematuria [1]. There is no reported association between nephrocalcinosis and renal vascular malformations. Although rare bilateral cases have been reported, generally these malformations are unilateral sources of hematuria. When diagnosed endoscopically, these vascular abnormalities have been classified as either discrete or diffuse lesions. Benign discrete lesions include renal hemangioma, minute venous rupture, or previously unidentified renal calculi. Although varices of the renal papillae have been categorized with MVR, there is a paucity of literature describing this unique clinical entity and its management. After obtaining informed voluntary consent from the patient, herein we describe a case of the incidental diagnosis and successful treatment of symptomatic varicosities of renal papillae in the setting of medullary nephrocalcinosis and recent pregnancy.
