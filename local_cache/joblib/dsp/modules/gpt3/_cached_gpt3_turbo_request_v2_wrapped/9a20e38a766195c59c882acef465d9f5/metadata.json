ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Pasireotide-LAR, a second-generation somatostatin receptor ligand (SRL), is recommended for patients with acromegaly as second-line treatment. Its efficacy and safety were assessed in clinical trials; however, the real-world evidence is still scarce. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of 1-year treatment with pasireotide-LAR on disease control and glucose metabolism in acromegaly patients resistant to first-generation SRLs. METHODS A single-center prospective study. METHODS Twenty-eight patients with active acromegaly or acrogigantism on first-generation SRLs following ineffective pituitary surgery were switched to treatment with pasireotide-LAR 40 or 60 mg i.m. every 28 days. To assess the efficacy of the treatment GH and IGF-1 levels were measured every 3 months. Safety of treatment was carefully evaluated, especially its impact on glucose metabolism. RESULTS Complete biochemical control (GH \\\\u2264 1 ng/mL and IGF-1 \\\\u2264 1 \\\\u00d7 ULN) was achieved in 26.9% of patients and partial + complete response (GH \\\\u2264 2.5 ng/mL and IGF-1 \\\\u2264 1.3 \\\\u00d7 ULN) in 50.0% of patients. Mean GH level decrease was the largest within first 6 months (P = 0.0001) and mean IGF-1 level decreased rapidly within the first 3 months (P < 0.0001) and they remained reduced during the study. Blood glucose and HbA1c levels increased significantly within 3 months (P = 0.0001) and stayed on stable level thereafter. Otherwise, the treatment was well tolerated and clinical improvement was noticed in majority of patients. CONCLUSIONS This real-life study confirmed good effectiveness of pasireotide-LAR in patients resistant to first-generation SRLs. Pasireotide-LAR was overall safe and well tolerated, however significant glucose metabolism worsening was noted. TEXT: pmcBackground Growth hormone (GH)-secreting pituitary adenoma is a leading cause of acromegaly and pituitary gigantism. The GH hypersecretion results in overproduction of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which contributes to somatic overgrowth, distorted body proportion (mainly involving the face and extremities) and systemic manifestations, such as upper airways obstruction, cardiovascular complications, and metabolic disorders [1\\\\u20133]. The most frequent (up to 50% of patients) metabolic disorders in acromegaly resulting from direct anti-insulin effects of GH is insulin resistance leading to glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus (DM) [4, 5]. The prevalence of glucose metabolism abnormalities in acromegaly varies considerably across different studies, but the prevalence of DM is estimated at 16\\\\u201356% [6]; additionally, a positive correlation between baseline IGF-1 level and DM was found [5, 7].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Diabetes mellitus, Drug ineffective, Drug resistance, Insulin resistance, Hypoglycaemia, Hyperglycaemia, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Glucose tolerance impaired, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Decreased appetite, Glucose tolerance decreased, Glucose tolerance increased, Impaired fasting glucose, Type 3 diabetes mellitus, Indeterminate glucose tolerance, Insulin-like growth factor, Blood glucose increased, Carbohydrate intolerance, Carbohydrate tolerance decreased, Insulin sparing effect, Diabetes mellitus inadequate control, Diabetic ketoacidosis, Blood glucose, Drug intolerance, Insulin resistant diabetes, Carbohydrate tolerance increased, Pancreatogenous diabetes, Drug interaction, Ketosis-prone diabetes mellitus, Diarrhoea, Blood glucose decreased, Fibroblast growth factor 23, Weight decreased, Increased insulin requirement, Diabetic complication, Blood growth hormone, Glucose-galactose malabsorption, Glucose tolerance impaired in pregnancy, Glucose urine, Insulin autoimmune syndrome, Blood glucose abnormal, Sucrose intolerance, Lactose intolerance, Fructose intolerance, Glucose tolerance test abnormal, Monogenic diabetes, Pituitary gonadotropin hyperfunction, Hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia, Diabetic metabolic decompensation, Insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes mellitus\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

The article discusses the impact of pasireotide-LAR on patients with acromegaly who are resistant to first-generation somatostatin receptor ligands (SRLs). It mentions that the treatment was overall safe and well tolerated, but significant worsening of glucose metabolism was noted. This implies that adverse reactions related to glucose metabolism are relevant. The article also discusses the prevalence of glucose metabolism abnormalities in acromegaly, including insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and diabetes mellitus.
