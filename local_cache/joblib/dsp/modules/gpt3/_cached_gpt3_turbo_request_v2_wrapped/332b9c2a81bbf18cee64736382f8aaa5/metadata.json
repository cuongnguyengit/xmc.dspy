ABSTRACT: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon and life-threating condition characterized by major immune activation and massive cytokine production by mononuclear inflammatory cells, due to defects in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. It is even more unusual in renal transplant recipients, in which it is often associated with uncontrolled infection. The mortality is high in HLH and differential diagnosis with sepsis is a challenge. The approach and management depend on the underlying trigger and comorbidities. We report a case of a 50-year-old renal transplant female admitted with fever and malaise 3 months post-transplant and presenting anemia, fever, hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of serum ferritin, and positive CMV antigenemia. Urine was positive for decoy cells and BKV-DNA. Graft biopsy showed CMV nephritis. Both blood and urine cultures where positive for E. coli. Hemophagocytosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone, with complete response after 3 weeks. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of a rare and serious condition in a renal transplant patient, which can allow a favorable clinical course and improve survival rate. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) consists of an immune hyperactivation syndrome that takes place when NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to eliminate activated macrophages, leading to over production of proinflammatory cytokines1. There are primary and acquired causes. Primary HLH is rare and typically manifests in childhood because of two autosomal recessive defects in genes that encode proteins involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules during apoptosis in natural killer (NK) cells.1 , 2Acquired (secondary) HLH is triggered by various conditions as infections, immunodeficiency, rheumatologic diseases, and cancer.1 , 3 , 4 Infection is the most common precipitating factor of HLH in adults, mainly viruses of herpes family (EBV, CMV, HSV, HHV8), but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens can also be a trigger.5 , 6 Multiorgan involvement and organomegaly are frequently found and hemophagocytosis results in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of HLH is based on the presence of at least 5 of the following 8 criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting \\\\u2265 2 lineages of peripheral blood cells), hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, serum ferritin >500 ng/mL, low activity of NK cells, soluble CD25 > 2.400 U/mL and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes.7 Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red cells, platelets, or white cells in macrophage cytoplasm visualized in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.2 The syndrome is defined by a complex picture. However, some patients may have incipient or partial disease.1 Most diagnostic\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Neutropenia, Pancytopenia, Infection, Thrombocytopenia, Cytomegalovirus infection, Febrile neutropenia, Bone marrow failure, Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Leukopenia, Hypertriglyceridaemia, Anaemia, Cytopenia, Fungal infection, Hyperglycaemia, Apoptosis, Bacterial infection, Herpes simplex, Agranulocytosis, Sepsis, Hyperlipidaemia, Granulocytopenia, Hypercholesterolaemia, Condition aggravated, Blood triglycerides increased, Platelet count decreased, Hyper HDL cholesterolaemia, Aplastic anaemia, Herpes virus infection, Pyrexia, Cell death, Herpes simplex hepatitis, Cytomegalovirus viraemia, Familial hypertriglyceridaemia, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Cytomegalovirus infection reactivation, Immune-mediated pancytopenia, Disease progression, Familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Type III hyperlipidaemia, Acquired mixed hyperlipidaemia, Varicella, Type I hyperlipidaemia, Autoimmune pancytopenia, Type II hyperlipidaemia, Infection parasitic, Type V hyperlipidaemia, Blood cholesterol increased, Lipids increased, Type IV hyperlipidaemia, Plasmablast count decreased\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of dalteparin during an elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedure in a large cohort. METHODS In this prospective, randomized, open-label design study, 733 patients undergoing elective PCI were divided into an unfractionated heparin group (group 1, 323 patients) or a dalteparin group (group 2, 410 patients). Blood samples were collected before and 18-24 h after the PCI procedure to determine the serum levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB. Major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and bleeding events during hospitalization were also recorded. Patients with an increased level of serum cTnI before PCI were excluded from the study. RESULTS After PCI, the cTnI values were greater than three times the upper limit of normal in 43 cases (13.3%) in group 1 and 52 cases (12.7%) in group 2, without a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.801). An increased creatine kinase isoenzyme MB level of greater than two times the upper limit of normal was found in 10 cases (3.1%) in group 1 and 12 cases (2.9%) in group 2, without a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P=0.894). Postoperative bleeding was observed in nine patients (2.8%) in group 1 and six patients (1.5%) in group 2. Postoperative MACEs were observed in two patients (0.6%) in group 1 and two patients (0.5%) in group 2. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to bleeding events or MACEs. CONCLUSIONS Our study showed that dalteparin might be as effective and safe as unfractionated heparin for anticoagulation during elective PCI.
