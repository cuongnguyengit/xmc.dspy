ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Fanconi-Bickel syndrome in an infant with cytomegalovirus infection: A case report and review of the literature. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Fanconi-Bickel syndrome (FBS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutation of the SLC2A2 gene, which encodes glucose transporter protein 2 (GLUT2). METHODS We report a 7-mo-old girl with cytomegalovirus infection presenting hepatomegaly, jaundice, liver transaminase elevation, fasting hypoglycemia, hyperglycosuria, proteinuria, hypophosphatemia, rickets, and growth retardation. After prescription of ganciclovir, the levels of bilirubin and alanine aminotransferase decreased to normal, while she still had aggravating hepatomegaly and severe hyperglycosuria. Then, whole exome sequencing was conducted and revealed a homozygous c.416delC mutation in exon 4 of SLC2A2 inherited from her parents, which was predicted to change alanine 139 to valine (p.A139Vfs*3), indicating a diagnosis of FBS. During the follow-up, the entire laboratory test returned to normal with extra supplement of vitamin D and corn starch. Her weight increased to normal range at 3 years old without hepatomegaly. However, she still had short stature. Although there was heterogeneity between phenotype and genotype, Chinese children had typical clinical manifestations. No hot spot mutation or association between severity and mutations was found, but nonsense and missense mutations were more common. Data of long-term follow-up were rare, leading to insufficient assessment of the prognosis in Chinese children. CONCLUSIONS FBS is a rare genetic metabolic disease causing impaired glucose liver homeostasis and proximal renal tubular dysfunction. Results of urine and blood testing suggesting abnormal glucose metabolism could be the clues for FBS in neonates and infants. Genetic sequencing is indispensable for diagnosis. Since the diversity of disease severity, early identification and long-term follow-up could help improve patients\\' quality of life and decrease mortality.
