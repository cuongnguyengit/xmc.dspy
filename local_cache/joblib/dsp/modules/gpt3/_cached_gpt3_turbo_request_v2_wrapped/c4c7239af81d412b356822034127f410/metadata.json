ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\\\\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: Anthracyclines constitute the backbone of intensive adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy. Cardiotoxicity is one of its most serious adverse effects, and its incidence increases with cumulative dose. Dexrazoxane is a cardioprotective agent used in conjunction with anthracycline therapy. There is limited data of its usage in adult AML patients. We report the outcomes of six older adults at high risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity who received dexrazoxane during induction/re-induction therapy. Five had preserved left-ventricular function while two proceeded onto stem-cell transplantation. Additional investigation of dexrazoxane in adult leukemia therapy is warranted, particularly in older patients at highest risk for cardiovascular mortality. TEXT: 1 Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for 80% of acute leukemia in adults with a median age at diagnosis of 65 years [1]. The standard upfront induction regimen for fit adult individuals remains \\\\u201c7+3\\\\u201d, consisting of 7 days of continuous infusion cytarabine and 3 days of an anthracycline, either daunorubicin or idarubicin [2]. Variations of induction and re-induction regimens in the refractory/relapsed disease setting often include either idarubicin or mitoxantrone in conjunction with high dose cytarabine and sometimes purine analogues. Medical comorbidities, specifically cardiovascular morbidity, have been shown to negatively impact the clinical outcomes of AML induction therapy in older adults. Cardiotoxicity constitutes the most frequently feared adverse event associated with the use of anthracyclines (>10%), and compromised cardiac function may compromise the use of potentially curative upfront and subsequent AML regimens in a patient\\'s course. Prevention or mitigation of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, particularly in older adults who constitute the majority of new AML diagnoses, is therefore an area of tremendous clinical relevance. Cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines is dose-dependent and can occur at any time in the treatment course with acute, subacute, and late-onset presentations. Clinical symptoms include arrhythmias, myopericarditis, cardiomyopathy, and congestive heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [3], [4], [5]. For example, the incidence of cardiotoxic events with use of doxorubicin was less than 5% at a cumulative dose of 400 mg/m2, but increased in a dose-dependent manner to 16% at a cumulative dose of 500 mg/m2, 26% at 550 mg/m2, and 48% at 700 mg/m2\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Cardiotoxicity, Toxic cardiomyopathy, Cytarabine syndrome, Toxicity to various agents, Chemotherapy cardiotoxicity attenuation, Drug interaction, Heart injury, Cardiac ablation, Death, Stress cardiomyopathy, Cardiogenic shock, Overdose, Neurotoxicity, Cardioactive drug level therapeutic, Drug ineffective, Cardiac disorder, Hepatotoxicity, Cardioactive drug level, Cardioactive drug level above therapeutic, Tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy, Chemotherapy, Athletic heart syndrome, Cardioactive drug level increased, Cardiomyopathy alcoholic, External counterpulsation, Cardiomyopathy, Tachycardia, Drug resistance, Cardiac procedure complication, Arrhythmia prophylaxis, Endocarditis prophylaxis, Myocardial reperfusion injury, Positive cardiac inotropic effect, Cardiac contusion, Cardiac infection, Radiation myocarditis, Thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy, Anaesthetic complication cardiac, Cardiac myxoma, Cardioactive drug level below therapeutic, Negative cardiac inotropic effect, Carcinoid heart disease, Poisoning, Cardiac operation, Cardioversion, Chemotherapy multiple agents systemic, Systemic toxicity, Cardiac iron overload, Myocarditis, Off label use\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
