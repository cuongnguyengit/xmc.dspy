ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: A poor prognostic metastatic nongestational choriocarcinoma of the ovary: a case report and the literature review. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Pure ovarian choriocarcinoma can be gestational or nongestational in origin. Nongestational pure ovarian choriocarcinoma is extremely rare and the prognosis is thought to be worse than that of the gestational type in patients with metastatic disease. We present a case of metastatic pure ovarian choriocarcinoma with poor prognosis in which the origin was identified as nongestational by DNA short tandem repeat (STR) analysis. METHODS A nulliparous woman in her thirties with metastatic choriocarcinoma was referred to our hospital after initial treatment proved unsuccessful. Two months earlier, she had undergone brain tumor resection and histological examination confirmed choriocarcinoma. Serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) concentration at initial diagnosis was 5030 IU/L. Two cycles of a combination chemotherapy regimen of methotrexate, etoposide, and actinomycin-D (MEA therapy), which is commonly used for gestational choriocarcinoma, was administered. However, the disease could not be controlled. Imaging modalities at presentation revealed tumor present in the left ovary and left lung, but not in the uterus, which led us think that the choriocarcinoma was nongestational. Bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP therapy) which is commonly used for nongestational choriocarcinoma (malignant germ cell tumor) and surgical resection of the uterus, bilateral ovaries, and an affected part of the left lung led to the nadir level of hCG, but the tumor relapsed and levels of hCG again increased. To investigate the origin of choriocarcinoma, we performed DNA STR analysis of tumor cells and oral mucosal cells. Analysis revealed the origin of the choriocarcinoma as nongestational, as the genotype of tumor cells entirely corresponded with that of oral mucosal cells. BEP therapy and chemotherapy regimens administered for nongestational choriocarcinoma and gestational choriocarcinoma proved ineffective, and the patient died 21 months after diagnosis of metastatic choriocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS Metastaic nongestational pure choriocarcinoma of ovary is an extremely rare and an aggressive disease, frequently resulting in poor outcome.

The article discusses a case of metastatic pure ovarian choriocarcinoma identified as nongestational. It mentions that the initial treatment with a chemotherapy regimen was unsuccessful, indicating treatment failure or drug ineffectiveness. The patient underwent additional chemotherapy and surgery, but the disease could not be controlled, and the patient eventually died, indicating disease progression and general physical health deterioration.
