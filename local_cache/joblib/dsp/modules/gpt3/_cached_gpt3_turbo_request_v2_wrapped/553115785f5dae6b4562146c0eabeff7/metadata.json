ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: ALK Rearrangement-Positive Pancreatic Cancer with Brain Metastasis Has Remarkable Response to ALK Inhibitors: A Case Report. ABSTRACT: Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer typically have poor prognosis due to the limited effectiveness of existing treatment options. ALK rearrangement-positive is rare in pancreatic cancer, but may occur in those with KRAS-wild type. We present a 34-year-old young man with ALK rearrangement-positive and KRAS-wild pancreatic cancer who had a remarkable response to crizotinib after resistance to prior chemotherapy and re-response to alectinib after brain metastases developed. This clinical observation suggests that comprehensive molecular profiling to guide targeted therapies is not only feasible, but also significantly improves survival outcomes for a subgroup of patients with pancreatic cancer. TEXT: pmcIntroduction According to the estimation of Global Cancer Statistics 2020, pancreatic cancer ranks seventh among cancer-related deaths worldwide (1). The median overall survival time (mOS) for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer is 8-12 months, while that is only 3-6 months for patients with distant metastases. Although surgery is the only way to cure pancreatic cancer, about 80% of patients\\\\u2019 tumors are unresectable at the first visit (2). Chemotherapy is the primary means of treatment for most patients. Unfortunately, existing chemotherapy regimens have limited effectiveness. First-line combination chemotherapy, for instance, using gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GN) or FOLFIRINOX (5- fluorouracil, folinic acid, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan) only increases the mOS of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer by 2-4 months in phase III trials (2, 3). In the cases of disease progression after GN therapy, nanoliposomal irinotecan (nal-IRI) can be given as second-line therapy, according to the landmark phase III NAPOLI-1 trial (4). However, therapeutic options are very limited after the failure of the standard treatment.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Metastases to central nervous system, Chemotherapy, Pancreatic carcinoma, Brain cancer metastatic, ALK gene rearrangement positive, Adenocarcinoma pancreas, Pancreatic carcinoma metastatic, Drug ineffective, Metastases to pancreas, Metastases to meninges, Metastases to nervous system, Chemotherapy single agent systemic, Ductal adenocarcinoma of pancreas, ALK gene rearrangement assay, Pancreatic sarcoma, Pancreatoblastoma, Prophylactic chemotherapy, Pancreatic carcinoma recurrent, Chemotherapy multiple agents systemic, Cystadenocarcinoma pancreas, Metastatic nervous system neoplasm, Regional chemotherapy, Brain neoplasm malignant, Acinar cell carcinoma of pancreas, Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour, Carcinoid tumour of the pancreas, Pancreatic neoplasm, Pancreatic carcinoma stage III, Pancreatic carcinoma stage I, Pancreatic carcinoma stage IV, Pancreatic carcinoma stage 0, Chemotherapy side effect prophylaxis, Metastatic glioma, Malignant neoplasm of islets of Langerhans, Pancreatic carcinoma stage II, Chemotherapy toxicity attenuation, Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour metastatic, Solid pseudopapillary tumour of the pancreas, Metastases to pituitary gland, Chemotherapy extravasation management, Immunosuppression, Drug therapy, Malignant neoplasm progression, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Drug interaction, ROS1 gene rearrangement, Pancreatic mass, Metastases to lung, Neoplasm prophylaxis, FIP1L1/PDGFR alpha fusion kinase positive\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653975.0107238}
