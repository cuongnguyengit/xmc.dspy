ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: Although hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is often associated with extrahepatic cutaneous manifestations such as lichen planus, it is unclear whether HCV per se or HCV-specific immune responses play a pathophysiological role in the development of HCV-related cutaneous diseases. We recently treated a patient who developed parapsoriasis en plaque-like lesions after ingestion of various drugs. She showed hypersensitivity to multiple drugs after interferon therapy. Her clinical course was complicated by flares of parapsoriasis-like lesions which returned at precisely the same sites. The flares had begun within hours of ingesting nicardipine hydrochloride, amlodipine besilate, candesartan cilexetil and atenolol for the first time despite showing a low level of HCV RNA. Interestingly, the flares gradually subsided during continued treatment with these drugs while her HCV RNA level paradoxically increased: thus, there was an inverse correlation between flares and HCV RNA level. The eruptions were eventually diagnosed as fixed drug eruption, although the clinical manifestations mimicked parapsoriasis en plaque. Our results suggest that multiple drug hypersensitivity could be induced by antiviral immune responses that are cross-reactive to multiple drugs, but not by HCV per se. TEXT: Introduction Although it has been reported that hepatitis C virus (HCV) can be pathogenic for several skin diseases [1, 2, 3], it is unclear whether HCV per se or hepatitis treatment agents cause these diseases. Although recently developed interferon (IFN)-free therapies for HCV shorten the treatment duration and alleviate sustained virologic responses [4], pegylated IFN (PEG-IFN) concomitant with ribavirin is used in patients with HCV genotype 1b [5, 6], and, as IFN is known to affect the cytokine cascade [7, 8], adverse effects of treatment with IFN plus ribavirin are attributed to IFN. Accordingly, since IFN can stimulate macrophages to produce IL-15, which activate anti-viral CD8 and natural killer cell responses [9], we hypothesized that adverse events in patients treated with these agents were IFN-induced immune responses not effects of HCV per se. If adverse events in HCV-infected patients were sustained HCV-specific immune responses, development or exacerbation of such events should be temporarily associated with decreased HCV viral load. We report serial measures of HCV viral load and incidence of comorbid dermal lesions in a patient with chronic HCV infection.
