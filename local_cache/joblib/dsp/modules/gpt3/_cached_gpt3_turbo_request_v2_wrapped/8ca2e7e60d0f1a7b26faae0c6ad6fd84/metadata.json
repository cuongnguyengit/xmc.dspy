ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: A 71-year-old male patient reported to our hospital with anaphylactic shock, and the following two issues were focused in this case. First, he was resistant to adrenaline because of taking beta-blocker, and shock was repeated until glucagon administration was initiated. Second, he developed acute coronary syndrome. Two mechanisms contributing to Kounis syndrome were differentiated: 1) adrenaline induced coronary spasm and platelet activation or 2) a mismatch between oxygen supply and demand due to an allergic reaction. Beta-blocker therapy was discontinued because his cardiac function was preserved. Secondary preventive beta-blockers in recovering myocardial infarction with severe anaphylaxis history should be carefully considered. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION The administration of adrenaline to resolve anaphylactic shock may be insufficient in patients taking oral beta\\\\u2010blockers (Lang, 1995). Additionally, adrenaline or anaphylaxis chemical mediators increase the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), referred to as Kounis syndrome (Kounis, 2016). Prior reports comprised 235,420 allergy patients have found a 1.1% prevalence and 7.0% inhospital mortality (Desai et al., 2019). Kounis classification has three variants: type 1, coronary spasm; type 2, coronary thrombus due to atherosclerotic plaque disruption and thrombus aggregation; and type 3, stent thrombosis/restenosis (Abdelghany et al., 2017). 2 CASE REPORT The patient was a 71\\\\u2010year\\\\u2010old male with a history of allergy to mackerel. Having worked as a landscaper for 20 years, however, he had no history of bee allergy. On a morning in August 2020, at 9:00 a.m., he began lawn mowing and was attacked by bees that stung him on the left lower eyelid, anterior forehead, left upper lip, and right dorsal hand. A colleague soon noticed his loss of consciousness and immediately called in the emergency. Upon on\\\\u2010site arrival (Figure 1, left), the vital signs were as follows: Japan coma scale 1, Glasgow coma scale 4\\\\u20135\\\\u20136, blood pressure 60 mmHg, heart rate 99bpm (regular), respiratory rate 30/min, oxygen saturation 90%, and pupil size 3 mm/3 mm with normal light reflex. General respiratory sounds were faint, although wheezing and rale were noted. The extremities were moist, and a rash with itching was present on the abdominal skin. The emergency dispatch physician administered 0.3 mg adrenaline intramuscular injection (i.m.) twice for the prolonged shock. FIGURE 1 Onset and course.
