The vacancy mentions a degree in \\\\\"Production Mechanical Electrical Marine Engineering (or similar)\\\\\" and the candidate might be \\\\\"newly educated.\\\\\" This suggests that the job requires a foundational understanding of engineering principles, particularly in the fields mentioned. Since the candidate might be newly educated, we can infer that the job may not require extensive experience but rather a solid educational background in the relevant engineering disciplines. We should look for skills that are related to mechanical, electrical, and marine engineering, as well as general engineering competencies that a recent graduate might possess.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: marine engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, operate mechanical equipment of ships, manage ship electrical systems, operate ship equipment, maintain shipboard machinery, maritime transportation technology, offshore constructions and facilities, provide support in vessel machinery systems\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: SQL experience is a plus but not required\\\\n\\\\nOptions: SQL, SQL Server, database, MySQL, use databases, PostgreSQL, Oracle Relational Database, data warehouse, database management systems, use query languages, query languages, manage database, Microsoft Access, operate relational database management system, database development tools, maintain database, data analytics, Teradata Database, CA Datacom/DB, business intelligence, Solidity, SPARQL, search databases, database quality standards, perform data mining, perform records management, data models, data mining, Drupal, maintain database performance, create data models, NoSQL, create database diagrams, manage quantitative data, implement data warehousing techniques, develop data processing applications, PHP, accounting, C#, design database scheme, SAP Data Services, DB2, use logic programming, manage data, data storage, balance database resources, SAS Data Management, perform data analysis, use accounting systems, use data processing techniques\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as beneficial for the job vacancy. The vacancy mentions \\\\\"SQL experience is a plus but not required,\\\\\" which suggests that while SQL skills are advantageous, they are not a mandatory requirement for the job. Therefore, we should focus on skills related to SQL and databases, as these are the most relevant to the statement provided.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: Skills: SQL, use databases, use query languages, query languages, manage database, database management systems, operate relational database management system, maintain database, create data models, manage data\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: You are capable of cooperating with colleagues in a professional and positive manner\\\\n\\\\nOptions: show professional responsibility, cooperate with professionals, create cooperation modalities, demonstrate professional attitude to clients, communication, social alliances, provide professional care in nursing, maintain professional administration, maintain work standards, maintain professional boundaries in social work, cooperate at inter-professional level, philanthropy, diplomatic principles, cooperate with colleagues, identify support mechanisms to develop your professional practice, social mediation, ethics, interact professionally in research and professional environments, apply socially just working principles, team building, report accounts of the professional activity, create social alliances, multi-professional cooperation in health care, negotiate compromises, teamwork principles, maintain professional records, apply diplomatic principles, establish collaborative relations, craftsmanship, social entreprise, develop professional identity in social work, practise veterinary professional codes of conduct, build community relations, follow company standards, personnel management, psychological measures in working with other health care professionals, public relations, health care occupation-specific ethics, develop international cooperation strategies, cooperate with education professionals, leadership principles, morality, social bonds, reinforce positive behaviour, professional documentation in health care, support the positiveness of youths, economics, adhere to standard procedures, work in teams, communication principles\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706652488.5794897}
