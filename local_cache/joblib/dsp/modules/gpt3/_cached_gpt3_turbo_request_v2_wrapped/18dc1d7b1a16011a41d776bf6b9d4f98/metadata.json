ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Isolated adrenocorticotropin deficiency induced by pembrolizumab for hypopharyngeal cancer: A case report. ABSTRACT: We report a case of isolated adrenocorticotropin deficiency caused by pembrolizumab. This condition can be fatal, but its rarity causes under-recognition. Oncologists should pay attention to adrenal insufficiency due to pembrolizumab. TEXT: A 78\\\\u2010year\\\\u2010old man with a history of surgery for hypopharyngeal cancer presented with a 3\\\\u2010day\\\\u2010long fever, anorexia, and vomiting. There were no other clinical symptoms. One week ago, he received the 11th cycle of pembrolizumab for lung metastasis. Since contrast\\\\u2010enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed no clear findings and empiric antibiotic therapy was ineffective, he was referred to our department for investigation of fever of unknown origin. He had hyponatremia (135 mmoL/L) and increased antidiuretic hormone level (3.0 pg/mL) without eosinophilia (242/\\\\u03bcL) or hypoglycemia (117 mg/dL). Basal plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) was undetectable, and serum cortisol level was significantly lowered (0.6 \\\\u03bcg/dL), and free cortisol in a twenty\\\\u2010four\\\\u2010hour urine collection was undetectable. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed no specific findings (Figure 1A) and plain adrenal CT showed no abnormality (Figure 1B). A corticotropin\\\\u2010releasing hormone test showed no response of ACTH or cortisol, while results for other anterior pituitary hormones in loading tests were unremarkable (Figure 1C). We diagnosed as isolated ACTH deficiency induced by pembrolizumab, which was improved by 10 mg per day of hydrocortisone treatment. FIGURE 1 A, Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed no remarkable pituitary enlargement, no thickened pituitary stalk, and no loss of signal intensity in the posterior lobe in T1\\\\u2010weighted image (sagittal plane). B, Plain computed tomography showed that the bilateral adrenals had normal shapes. C, Anterior pituitary hormonal evaluation. A corticotropin\\\\u2010releasing hormone (CRH) test (upper left) showed no response of ACTH or cortisol, while a gonadotropin\\\\u2010releasing hormone (GnRH) test (upper right), thyrotropin\\\\u2010releasing hormone (TRH) test (lower left), and growth hormone\\\\u2010releasing peptide 2 (GHRP2) test (lower right) showed no remarkable results. ACTH, adrenocorticotropin; FSH, follicle\\\\u2010stimulating hormone; GH, growth hormone; LH, luteinizing hormone; PRL, prolactin; TSH, thyroid\\\\u2010stimulating hormone The programmed cell death 1 protein (PD\\\\u20101) inhibitor pembrolizumab has rarely been reported to cause isolated ACTH deficiency, in contrast to the same class agent nivolumab. 1 As in our case, PD\\\\u20101 inhibitors induce hypophysitis with less obvious clinical signs (such as headache and vision disorder) and radiological signs than does cytotoxic T\\\\u2010lymphocyte antigen\\\\u20104. 2 Since this feature may lead to delayed or incorrect diagnosis, oncologists should recognize that pembrolizumab can induce ACTH deficiency.
