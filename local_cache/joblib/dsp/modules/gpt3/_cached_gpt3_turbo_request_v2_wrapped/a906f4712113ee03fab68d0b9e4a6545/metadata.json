ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Treatment of severe acute ulcerative colitis in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients: report of three cases and discussion of treatment options. ABSTRACT: In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, it is unclear how asymptomatic severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)-infected patients who present with acute severe ulcerative colitis (UC) can be treated effectively and safely. Standard treatment regimens consist of steroids, immunomodulatory drugs, and biological therapies, but therapeutic decision-making becomes challenging as there are uncertainties about how to deal with these drugs in patients with COVID-19 and active UC. Importantly, guidelines for this particular group of patients with UC are still lacking. To inform therapeutic decision-making, we describe three consecutive cases of patients with active UC and COVID-19 and discuss their treatments based on theoretical knowledge, currently available evidence and clinical observations. Three patients were identified through our national inflammatory bowel disease network [Initiative on Crohn\\'s and Colitis (ICC)] for whom diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2-infection was established by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing in nasopharynx, stools, and/or biopsies. Acute severe UC was diagnosed by clinical parameters, endoscopy, and histopathology. Clinical guidelines for SARS-CoV-2-negative patients advocate the use of steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\\\\u03b1)-antagonists as induction therapy, and experiences from the current three cases show that steroids and TNF-\\\\u03b1-antagonists could also be used in patients with COVID-19. This could potentially be followed by TNF-\\\\u03b1-antagonists, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab as maintenance therapy in these patients. Future research is warranted to investigate if, and which, immunomodulatory drugs should be used for COVID-19 patients that present with active UC. To answer this question, it is of utmost importance that future cases of patients with UC and COVID-19 are documented carefully in international registries, such as the SECURE-IBD registry.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses the treatment of severe acute ulcerative colitis in patients who are also infected with SARS-CoV-2. It mentions the use of steroids, immunomodulatory drugs, and biological therapies, specifically TNF-\\\\u03b1-antagonists. The article does not explicitly list adverse reactions to these treatments but discusses the challenges in therapeutic decision-making due to uncertainties about how to deal with these drugs in patients with COVID-19 and active UC.
