ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Polycystic liver disease is a rare disease characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the liver. The liver function remains well preserved, but liver volumes can grow very large, and some patients ultimately need a liver transplantation. Other treatment options are limited and there is an unmet need for new therapeutic options. We describe a 59-year-old patient with pain in the abdomen, especially when bending forward. Five years ago, she was diagnosed with breast cancer and as an incidental finding a couple of large liver cysts were diagnosed, explaining her abdominal pain. METHODS Polycystic liver disease with several large liver cysts. METHODS The patient was treated with tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor modulator, as treatment for her hormone receptor positive breast cancer. One of the liver cysts was aspirated. RESULTS In the 4.6 years after the start of tamoxifen treatment, 20 mg once daily, the volume of her liver cysts decreased remarkably. There was a reduction of combined cyst volume from 311 mL to 22 mL without percutaneous drainage. CONCLUSIONS Epidemiological as well as experimental evidence supports a pivotal role for estrogens as a driver for growth of polycystic livers. Estrogen antagonism has often been proposed as a therapeutic target, but supporting evidence is lacking in the literature. We hypothesize that the decrease in cyst size in this patient was caused by tamoxifen therapy, suggesting an in vivo antagonistic effect on cystic cholangiocytes. This is an important finding because tamoxifen could be a promising new treatment option for polycystic liver disease. TEXT: 1 Introduction Polycystic liver disease (PLD) is a rare disease characterized by growth of numerous cysts in the liver and hepatomegaly.[1] While synthetic function remains preserved, the hepatomegaly may cause severe symptoms and a compromised quality of life, necessitating a liver transplantation.[1,2] Somatostatin analogues are the only available drug option that reduce cyst growth, but the effect is relatively small (3%\\\\u20138% reduction of liver volume after 6\\\\u201312 months of treatment) and it is not uniformly effective.[3] This highlights the need for new therapies. Epidemiological as well as experimental evidence points to an important role of estrogens as drivers of liver cyst growth.[4\\\\u20136] As such, the estrogen pathway may be an important therapeutic target for new medical therapies. Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM), has been specifically suggested as an option.[7,8] We describe a PLD patient with large liver cysts, who received tamoxifen as treatment for hormone receptor positive breast cancer. During tamoxifen treatment the volume of the liver cysts decreased remarkably. The patient gave informed consent for publication and because all interventions took part in the framework of clinical care, no ethics approval was needed. 2 Case report\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Breast cancer, Hormone receptor positive breast cancer, Polycystic liver disease, Hepatic cyst, Breast cancer female, Cyst, Hepatobiliary cyst, Breast cancer male, HER2 positive breast cancer, Invasive breast carcinoma, Malignant nipple neoplasm, Neuroendocrine breast tumour, Oestradiol, Breast cancer metastatic, Triple positive breast cancer, Malignant nipple neoplasm female, Oestriol, Invasive ductal breast carcinoma, Biliary cyst, Breast sarcoma, HER2 negative breast cancer, Inflammatory carcinoma of the breast, Cystic fibrosis hepatic disease, Hormone refractory breast cancer, Metaplastic breast carcinoma, Malignant nipple neoplasm male, Metastases to breast, Hepatic cyst infection, Oestrogenic effect, Hepatic cyst ruptured, Medullary carcinoma of breast, Breast cancer in situ, Haemorrhagic hepatic cyst, Apocrine breast carcinoma, Congenital hepatobiliary anomaly, Squamous cell breast carcinoma, Aromatase inhibition therapy, Tubular breast carcinoma, Oestrogen replacement therapy, Triple negative breast cancer, Oestrone, Breast cancer stage I, Retention cyst, Choledochal cyst, Oestrogen therapy, Breast cancer stage II, Cholangiectasis congenital, Hepatic mass, Dermal cyst, Breast cancer stage IV\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653968.18414}
