ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\\\\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\\\\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\\\\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \\\\u201cI think I\\\\u2019m having a stroke.\\\\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\\\\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Hypokalaemia, Anxiety, Hypomagnesaemia, Blood pressure increased, Hypotension, Hyponatraemia, Alcohol abuse, Hyperkalaemia, Hypocalcaemia, Alcohol use disorder, Blood potassium decreased, Alcoholism, Alcohol problem, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Drug abuse, Alcohol use, Anxiety disorder, Labile hypertension, Malignant hypertension, Hypokalaemic syndrome, Panic reaction, Alcoholic, Hypertensive urgency, Essential hypertension, Hypermagnesaemia, Nervousness, Urine potassium decreased, Alcohol poisoning, Panic disorder, Fear, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Alcoholic psychosis, Panic attack, Hypertensive angiopathy, Orthostatic hypertension, Generalised anxiety disorder, Alkalosis hypokalaemic, Electrolyte imbalance, Phobia, Alcoholic coma, Blood magnesium decreased, Idiosyncratic alcohol intoxication, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Renal hypertension, Blood alcohol, Prehypertension\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Hodgkin\\'s disease is recognized as part of the spectrum of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), although it is still an uncommon de novo malignancy in this population. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been linked to both post-transplant non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphomas and Hodgkin\\'s disease. We report a case of recurrent Hodgkin\\'s disease in a patient who received a renal transplant in childhood and later developed EBV-associated Hodgkin\\'s disease with remission after chemotherapy until subsequent relapse 9 years later that was successfully treated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of recurrent Hodgkin\\'s disease in a transplant recipient. We briefly discuss the pathogenesis of and risk factors for EBV-related PTLD, utility of EBV load surveillance, and the options for treatment of PTLD including immunosuppression reduction, antiviral therapy, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, cytotoxic T cells, and the possible roles of interferon-alpha and rapamycin. TEXT: Case report The patient is a 27-year-old white man who received a living-related donor transplant from his father at 11 years of age in 1986 for end stage renal disease secondary to posterior urethral valves. The patient was seronegative for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein\\\\u2013Barr virus (EBV) prior to transplantation. His father\\'s EBV and CMV status were unavailable. The transplant course was complicated by immediate postoperative acute renal artery thrombosis, which required transplant nephrectomy. He then received a deceased donor renal transplant 10 days later. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (Sandimmune formulation), azathioprine, and prednisone. He received 12 doses of Minnesota equine antilymphocyte immunoglobulin (MALG) for induction followed by 10 doses of murine anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) for two episodes of acute graft rejection over the 7 weeks following the transplant. The deceased donor\\'s EBV and CMV status were unavailable from medical records. The patient developed acute infectious mononucleosis 2 months after transplantation demonstrated by positive EBV serology. He was treated with acyclovir and the infectious mononucleosis resolved. At the age of 18, he presented with 5 months of fever, weight-loss and night sweats, and was found to have axillary adenopathy, splenomegaly and bulky right mediastinal adenopathy. A right anterior, thoracotomy and lymph node biopsy demonstrated Hodgkin\\'s disease, nodular sclerosing subtype. Hodgkin\\'s\\\\u2013Reed\\\\u2013Sternberg (HRS) cells were strongly positive for CD30 and EBV-latent membrane protein (LMP)-1. He was staged as Hodgkin\\'s disease-IIIB. His EBV serology demonstrated elevated antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG titers and positive anti-VCA IgM, consistent with reactivation of EBV infection.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Drug ineffective, Post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, Hodgkin\\'s disease, Immunosuppression, Hodgkin\\'s disease recurrent, Antiviral treatment, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type recurrent, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion type recurrent, Treatment failure, Hodgkin\\'s disease mixed cellularity recurrent, Lymphoproliferative disorder, Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, Antiviral prophylaxis, Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphoproliferative disorder, Hodgkin\\'s disease nodular sclerosis recurrent, Antiretroviral therapy, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type stage unspecified, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion type stage unspecified, Hodgkin\\'s disease mixed cellularity stage unspecified, Hodgkin\\'s disease stage III, Alpha interferon therapy, Hodgkin\\'s disease unclassifiable, Drug resistance, Hodgkin\\'s disease refractory, Hodgkin\\'s disease stage IV, Hodgkin\\'s disease stage II, Lymphoma, Lymphoproliferative disorder in remission, Disease recurrence, Interferon therapy, Hodgkin\\'s disease stage I, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type stage III, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type refractory, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance stage II site unspec, Beta interferon therapy, Immunomodulatory therapy, Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, Malignant lymphoid neoplasm, Immune disorder prophylaxis, Graft versus host disease, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type stage IV, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Disease progression, Gamma interferon therapy, Therapeutic response decreased, Anti-interferon antibody, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance stage I site unspec, Hodgkin\\'s disease nodular sclerosis, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion type refractory, Interferon alpha level\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653703.328091}
