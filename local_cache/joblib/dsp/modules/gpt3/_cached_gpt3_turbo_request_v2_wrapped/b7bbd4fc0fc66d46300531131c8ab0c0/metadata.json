ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Efficacy and Feasibility of Programmed Death-1/Programmed Death Ligand-1 Blockade Therapy in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients With High Antinuclear Antibody Titers. ABSTRACT: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has been described to markedly improve patient survival. However, reports describing the antitumor therapeutic efficacy and safety of ICIs in patients with autoantibodies are scarce. This study examined the efficacy and feasibility of ICIs in antinuclear antibody (ANA)-positive patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). An ANA titer greater than 1:40 and 1:80 was defined as positive and high, respectively. Patients who were treated with ICIs at Saitama Medical University, International Medical Center between January 2016 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. One hundred and nineteen of the 266 patients (44.7%) who received nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab had positive ANA titers. Their median age was 69 (range, 39-84) years. The overall response rate of the ANA-positive patients was 35.9% (37/103), which was not less than that of the ANA-negative group. The median progression-free survival in the ANA-positive group was 6.3 months versus 4.3 months in the ANA-negative group (p = 0.08). Twenty-seven ANA-positive patients (10.2%) had high ANA titers. However, ICI efficacy was not decreased in these patients. Regardless of the cutoff of ANA titers (1:40 or 1:80), the rate of patients who experienced adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups. The administration of ICIs to ANA-positive patients has clinical benefits. The prevalence of adverse events in the ANA-positive group was not higher than that in the ANA-negative group.
