ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is the leading cause of acute liver injury (ALI), market withdrawal of a drug, and rejection of applications for marketing licenses. The incidence of DILI is very low, with a value between 1 and 19 per 100,000 patient years. All antidepressants may induce DILI even at low therapeutic doses. In this report, we present a case of ALI after venlafaxine administration. A 27-year-old Chinese Han woman was admitted for depression. Several serum liver function indices in this patient were abnormal after antidepressant treatment. The Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) causality assessment score was 8, and the R value was 31.18. The patient was diagnosed with hepatocellular ALI, which was derived from venlafaxine-related adverse events. METHODS First, all medications were stopped to block the progression of DILI. Then, a hepatoprotective strategy and proper psychological treatment were performed to recover the impaired hepatic function. RESULTS Liver function was fully recovered as indicated by liver function indices and ultrasound imaging. CONCLUSIONS The possibility of DILI should not be overlooked during the long-term use of antipsychotic drugs. In response, regular liver function monitoring should be performed in a timely manner to avoid missing diagnoses and delayed treatment. Furthermore, the necessary medical treatment needs to be conducted after the occurrence of ALI. TEXT: pmc1 Introduction As a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, venlafaxine (VEN) has been proven to be well tolerated with a rate of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of less than 1/1000.[1] The most common ADRs[2,3] are mild, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diarrhea, dry mouth, decreased appetite, constipation, somnolence, and so on, all of which might be caused by serotonin toxicity or vulnerability to drug-drug interactions.[4] Notably, VEN-induced acute liver injury (ALI) has been less reported since its approval in 1993.[5\\\\u20137] It has been confirmed that VEN can result in transient asymptomatic elevations in serum aminotransferase levels and has been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent ALI.[8] However, the mechanism by which VEN causes ALI is unknown. In this case report, we describe 1 patient with depression who was diagnosed with ALI after the administration of VEN. 2 Case presentation\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Nausea, Diarrhoea, Vomiting, Decreased appetite, Dizziness, Somnolence, Acute kidney injury, Constipation, Dry mouth, Acute hepatic failure, Drug-induced liver injury, Liver injury, Weight decreased, Fatigue, Ultrasound scan, Insomnia, Hepatotoxicity, Vertigo, Hepatic failure, Lethargy, Abdominal pain, Hepatocellular injury, Appetite disorder, Vomiting projectile, Liver function test, Lip dry, Dizziness postural, Confusional state, Dry throat, Mixed liver injury, Defaecation urgency, Stupor, Diarrhoea infectious, Somnambulism, Altered state of consciousness, Tongue dry, Disorientation, Headache, Increased appetite, Faecal vomiting, Hypersomnia, Defaecation disorder, Vertigo labyrinthine, Hepatitis acute, Tachycardia, Post procedural diarrhoea, Traumatic liver injury, Diarrhoea haemorrhagic, Bacterial diarrhoea, Frequent bowel movements\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653916.1056638}
