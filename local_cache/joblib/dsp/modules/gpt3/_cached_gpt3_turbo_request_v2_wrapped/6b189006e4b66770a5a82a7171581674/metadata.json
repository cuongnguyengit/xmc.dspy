The vacancy mentions a degree in \\\\\"Production Mechanical Electrical Marine Engineering (or similar)\\\\\" and the candidate might be \\\\\"newly educated.\\\\\" This suggests that the job requires a foundational understanding of engineering principles, particularly in the fields mentioned. Since the candidate might be newly educated, we can infer that the job may not require extensive experience but rather a solid educational background in the relevant engineering disciplines. We should look for skills that are related to mechanical, electrical, and marine engineering, as well as general engineering competencies that a recent graduate might possess.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: marine engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, operate mechanical equipment of ships, manage ship electrical systems, operate ship equipment, maintain shipboard machinery, maritime transportation technology, offshore constructions and facilities, provide support in vessel machinery systems\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: SQL experience is a plus but not required\\\\n\\\\nOptions: SQL, SQL Server, database, MySQL, use databases, PostgreSQL, Oracle Relational Database, data warehouse, database management systems, use query languages, query languages, manage database, Microsoft Access, operate relational database management system, database development tools, maintain database, data analytics, Teradata Database, CA Datacom/DB, business intelligence, Solidity, SPARQL, search databases, database quality standards, perform data mining, perform records management, data models, data mining, Drupal, maintain database performance, create data models, NoSQL, create database diagrams, manage quantitative data, implement data warehousing techniques, develop data processing applications, PHP, accounting, C#, design database scheme, SAP Data Services, DB2, use logic programming, manage data, data storage, balance database resources, SAS Data Management, perform data analysis, use accounting systems, use data processing techniques\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as beneficial for the job vacancy. The vacancy mentions \\\\\"SQL experience is a plus but not required,\\\\\" which suggests that while SQL skills are advantageous, they are not a mandatory requirement for the job. Therefore, we should focus on skills related to SQL and databases, as these are the most relevant to the statement provided.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: Skills: SQL, use databases, use query languages, query languages, manage database, database management systems, operate relational database management system, maintain database, create data models, manage data\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: Are you able to handle complex pricing calculations?\\\\n\\\\nOptions: set up pricing strategies, prepare cost-plus pricing models, pricing strategies, market pricing, identify pricing opportunities, price product, maintain pricing database, negotiate price, calculate tote price, manage logistics pricing systems, quote prices, estimate costs of required supplies, calculate production costs, provide customers with price information, make price recommendations, determine resale value of items, parts pricing, calculate design costs, evaluate cost of software products, perform financial analysis on price strategies, carry out calculations, communicate price changes, put up price tags, business valuation techniques, negotiate prices for transport of cargo, calculate sales commission, oversee promotional sales prices, carry out calculations in hospitality, calculate cost of covering, negotiate on asset value, negotiate buying conditions, set prices of menu items, provide support in financial calculation, negotiate sale of commodities, determine charges for customer services, calculate utility payments, calculate purchasing levels of raw materials, cost management, assess operating cost, estimate costs in farm, estimate cost of building materials, perform stock valuation, calculate rates per hours, negotiate price for antiques, execute analytical mathematical calculations, negotiate sales contracts, examine cost of antiquarian goods, compile drinks price lists, estimate value of used goods, maximise sales revenues\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as necessary for the job vacancy. The vacancy asks if the candidate is \\\\\"able to handle complex pricing calculations,\\\\\" which indicates that the job requires the ability to perform intricate mathematical operations related to pricing. We should look for skills that involve pricing, calculations, and potentially financial analysis, as these are directly related to the ability to handle complex pricing calculations.\\\\n\\\\nSkills:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706652489.9038324}
