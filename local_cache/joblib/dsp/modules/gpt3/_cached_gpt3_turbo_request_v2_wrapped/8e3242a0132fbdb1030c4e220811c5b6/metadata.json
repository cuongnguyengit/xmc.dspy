ABSTRACT: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon and life-threating condition characterized by major immune activation and massive cytokine production by mononuclear inflammatory cells, due to defects in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. It is even more unusual in renal transplant recipients, in which it is often associated with uncontrolled infection. The mortality is high in HLH and differential diagnosis with sepsis is a challenge. The approach and management depend on the underlying trigger and comorbidities. We report a case of a 50-year-old renal transplant female admitted with fever and malaise 3 months post-transplant and presenting anemia, fever, hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of serum ferritin, and positive CMV antigenemia. Urine was positive for decoy cells and BKV-DNA. Graft biopsy showed CMV nephritis. Both blood and urine cultures where positive for E. coli. Hemophagocytosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone, with complete response after 3 weeks. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of a rare and serious condition in a renal transplant patient, which can allow a favorable clinical course and improve survival rate. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) consists of an immune hyperactivation syndrome that takes place when NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to eliminate activated macrophages, leading to over production of proinflammatory cytokines1. There are primary and acquired causes. Primary HLH is rare and typically manifests in childhood because of two autosomal recessive defects in genes that encode proteins involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules during apoptosis in natural killer (NK) cells.1 , 2Acquired (secondary) HLH is triggered by various conditions as infections, immunodeficiency, rheumatologic diseases, and cancer.1 , 3 , 4 Infection is the most common precipitating factor of HLH in adults, mainly viruses of herpes family (EBV, CMV, HSV, HHV8), but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens can also be a trigger.5 , 6 Multiorgan involvement and organomegaly are frequently found and hemophagocytosis results in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of HLH is based on the presence of at least 5 of the following 8 criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting \\\\u2265 2 lineages of peripheral blood cells), hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, serum ferritin >500 ng/mL, low activity of NK cells, soluble CD25 > 2.400 U/mL and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes.7 Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red cells, platelets, or white cells in macrophage cytoplasm visualized in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.2 The syndrome is defined by a complex picture. However, some patients may have incipient or partial disease.1 Most diagnostic\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Neutropenia, Pancytopenia, Infection, Thrombocytopenia, Cytomegalovirus infection, Febrile neutropenia, Bone marrow failure, Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Leukopenia, Hypertriglyceridaemia, Anaemia, Cytopenia, Fungal infection, Hyperglycaemia, Apoptosis, Bacterial infection, Herpes simplex, Agranulocytosis, Sepsis, Hyperlipidaemia, Granulocytopenia, Hypercholesterolaemia, Condition aggravated, Blood triglycerides increased, Platelet count decreased, Hyper HDL cholesterolaemia, Aplastic anaemia, Herpes virus infection, Pyrexia, Cell death, Herpes simplex hepatitis, Cytomegalovirus viraemia, Familial hypertriglyceridaemia, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Cytomegalovirus infection reactivation, Immune-mediated pancytopenia, Disease progression, Familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Type III hyperlipidaemia, Acquired mixed hyperlipidaemia, Varicella, Type I hyperlipidaemia, Autoimmune pancytopenia, Type II hyperlipidaemia, Infection parasitic, Type V hyperlipidaemia, Blood cholesterol increased, Lipids increased, Type IV hyperlipidaemia, Plasmablast count decreased\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: This retrospective study was to compare the efficacy of intravitreal injection of ranibizumab and aflibercept for patients with pachychoroid neovasculopathy. 54 eyes were initially treated with 3 monthly loading injections of ranibizumab or aflibercept. Treatment switching from ranibizumab to aflibercept, and aflibercept to photodynamic therapy was done at 3 months in case of incomplete fluid absorption. At 3 months, the rate of complete fluid absorption was significantly higher in the aflibercept-treated group than in the ranibizumab-treated group (82.6% vs 51.6%, p = 0.018). The mean reduction of subfoveal choroidal thickness was significantly greater in the aflibercept group than in the ranibizumab group (-35 \\\\u00b5m vs -9 \\\\u00b5m, p = 0.013). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of visual improvement or decrease in central macular thickness. Complete fluid absorption was achieved after switching from ranibizumab to aflibercept in 13 of 15 eyes (86.7%). Adjunctive photodynamic therapy was required in 6 eyes. In conclusion, treatment mainly with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor effectively improved visual acuity within 12 months (from 20/56 to 20/44 at 3 months and to 20/36 at 12 months). Aflibercept was superior to ranibizumab in achieving dry macula and reducing choroidal thickness at 3 months. TEXT: Introduction The term \\\\u201cpachychoroid neovasculopathy\\\\u201d has been introduced to describe Type 1 neovascularization associated with choroidal thickening and/or dilated Haller vessels in the absence of characteristic age-related macular degeneration features1,2. It is a newly recognized clinical entity of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) that is thought to be induced by pachychoroid phenotype\\\\u2013driven pathophysiological mechanisms3. This disease entity has been suggested to be in the spectrum between central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Pang and Freund reported that pachychoroid neovasculopathy can develop after long-standing CSC and may eventually progress to PCV in some cases2.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, Serous retinopathy, Retinal thickening, Choroidal sclerosis, Choroidal neovascularisation, Chorioretinopathy, Serpiginous choroiditis, Serous retinal detachment, Telangiectasia congenital, Hamartoma vascular, Telangiectasia, Haemangioma congenital, Choroidal effusion, Haemangioma, Haemangioma of skin, Chorioretinal disorder, Subretinal fluid, Birdshot chorioretinopathy, Choroidal dystrophy, Cerebral capillary telangiectasia, Choroidal detachment, Arterial dolichoectasia, Retinal vasculitis, Exudative retinopathy, Macular fibrosis, Retinal fibrosis, Disease progression, Choroidal haemangioma, Naevus flammeus, Chorioretinal atrophy, Sturge-Weber syndrome, Haemangioma of liver, Gastrointestinal angiectasia, Naevus spider congenital, Spider naevus, Chorioretinal scar, Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, Intra-abdominal haemangioma, Haemangioma of retina, Myopic chorioretinal degeneration, Subretinal hyperreflective exudation, Congenital cerebral haemangioma, Vascular malformation, Retinoschisis, Cystoid macular oedema, Infantile haemangioma, Retinal detachment, Subretinal fibrosis, Retinal exudates, Retinal telangiectasia\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653350.426081}
