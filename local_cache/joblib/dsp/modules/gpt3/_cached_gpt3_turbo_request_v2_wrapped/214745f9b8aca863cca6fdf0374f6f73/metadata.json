ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Premature atrial contractions with multiple patterns of aberrant conduction followed by torsade de pointes in a patient with polymyalgia rheumatica: A case report. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Recent studies have shown that QT interval prolongation is associated with disease severity and predicts mortality in systemic inflammatory diseases, particularly rheumatoid arthritis. Systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines released from synovial tissues in rheumatoid arthritis, such as interleukin (IL)-1\\\\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\\\\u03b1, could have direct effects on cardiac electrophysiology, particularly changes in the expression and function of potassium and calcium channels, resulting in QT interval prolongation on surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and an increased predisposition to develop lethal ventricular arrhythmias. However, reports on torsade de pointes (TdP) due to acquired long QT syndrome in patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) are limited. An 85-year-old Japanese woman with active PMR developed first syncope. METHODS Frequent premature atrial contractions (PACs) with multiple patterns of aberrant conduction, QT interval prolongation, and morphological T-U wave variability followed by TdP were documented. PACs were the first beat of TdP. METHODS Amiodarone, together with magnesium and potassium, was intravenously administered. However, TdP resulted in a ventricular arrhythmic storm, for which sedation with mechanical ventilatory support, temporary overdrive cardiac pacing, and intravenous landiolol administration in addition to multiple direct current shocks were effective. RESULTS Approximately 2 years later, the patient was treated with amiodarone, propranolol, and prednisolone. She did not undergo implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation and was quite well, with no recurrence of ventricular tachyarrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS IL-6 hyperproduction in inflamed tissues has been widely confirmed in PMR. Frequent PACs with various patterns of aberrant conduction, QT interval prolongation, and morphological T-U wave variability followed by TdP, for which IL-6-mediated enhancement of L-type Ca2+ current and inhibition of the rapid component of the delayed rectifier K+ current are the most likely mechanisms, were documented in an elderly Japanese woman with PMR. ECG may be recorded once in patients with active PMR even when these patients do not complain of palpitation or syncope. If QT interval prolongation or arrhythmia, including even PACs, is observed, follow-up ECG may be warranted, particularly for patients with some risk factors for QT prolongation that could lead to TdP, such as advanced age, female sex, hypopotassemia, and polypharmacy.
