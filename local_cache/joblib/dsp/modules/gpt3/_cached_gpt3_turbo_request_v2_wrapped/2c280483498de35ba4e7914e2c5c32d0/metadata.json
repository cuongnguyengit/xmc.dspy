ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: HTLV-1 associated acute adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia presenting as acute liver failure in Micronesian: A case report. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Malignant infiltration accounts for 0.5% of acute liver failure cases, with non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma the predominant cause. Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL) is a rarer source of acute hepatitis, with only 3 cases reported and all resulting in immediate deterioration with death. ATLL rises from human T-lymphocytic virus-1 (HTLV-1), commonly found in Japan (southern and northern islands), the Caribbean, Central and South America, intertropical Africa, Romania, and northern Iran. In Micronesia, HTLV-1 infection amongst native-born is absent or exceedingly rare. A 77-year-old Marshallese man presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of generalized weakness, fatigue, and nausea. The physical exam revealed a cervical papulonodular exanthem and scleral icterus. METHODS Laboratory studies were remarkable for aspartate-aminotransferase of 230 IU/L (reference range [RR]: 0-40), alanine-aminotransferase of 227 IU/L (RR: 0-41), alkaline phosphatase of 133 IU/L (RR: 35-129), and total bilirubin of 4.7 mg/dL (RR: 0-1.2), supporting acute liver injury. Platelet count was 11.6x104/\\\\u03bcL (RR: 15.1-42.4 \\\\u00d7 104), hemoglobin was 13.8 g/dL (RR: 13.7-17.5), and white blood cell count was 7570/\\\\u03bcL (RR: 3800-10,800) with 81.8% neutrophils (RR: 34.0-72.0) and 10.4% lymphocytes (RR: 12.0-44.0). The peripheral blood smear demonstrated abnormal lymphocytes with occasional flower cell morphology. HTLV-1/2 antibody tested positive. The skin and liver biopsies confirmed atypical T-cell infiltrate. The diagnosis of ATLL was established. METHODS The patient elected for palliative chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP). He began antiviral treatment with zidovudine 250 mg bis in die (BID) indefinitely. Ursodiol and cholestyramine were added for his hyperbilirubinemia. RESULTS Four weeks from admission, the patient returned to near baseline functional status and was discharged home. CONCLUSIONS This case highlights that ATLL can initially present as isolated acute hepatitis, and how careful examination of peripheral blood-smear may elucidate hepatitis etiology. We also present support for utilizing ursodiol with cholestyramine for treating a hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, unlike prior reports of ATLL presenting as liver dysfunction, combined antiviral and CVP chemotherapy was effective in this case. Lastly, there are seldom demographic reports of HTLV-1 infection from the Micronesian area, and our case represents the first indexed case of HTLV-1-associated-ATLL presenting as acute liver failure in a Marshallese patient.

The article discusses a case of acute adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATLL) presenting as acute liver failure. It mentions that malignant infiltration is a rare cause of acute liver failure and that ATLL is an even rarer source. The patient presented with symptoms of acute liver injury, and laboratory studies supported this finding. The diagnosis of ATLL was established through laboratory tests and biopsies. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and antiviral treatment, and his condition improved. The article does not mention renal failure, respiratory failure, or other organ dysfunctions, so we should not include those in our list\\\\n\\\\nReactions:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706654005.7234728}
