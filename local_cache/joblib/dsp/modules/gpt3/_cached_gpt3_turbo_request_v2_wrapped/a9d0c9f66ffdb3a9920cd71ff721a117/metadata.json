The vacancy mentions a degree in \\\\\"Production Mechanical Electrical Marine Engineering (or similar)\\\\\" and the candidate might be \\\\\"newly educated.\\\\\" This suggests that the job requires a foundational understanding of engineering principles, particularly in the fields mentioned. Since the candidate might be newly educated, we can infer that the job may not require extensive experience but rather a solid educational background in the relevant engineering disciplines. We should look for skills that are related to mechanical, electrical, and marine engineering, as well as general engineering competencies that a recent graduate might possess.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: marine engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, operate mechanical equipment of ships, manage ship electrical systems, operate ship equipment, maintain shipboard machinery, maritime transportation technology, offshore constructions and facilities, provide support in vessel machinery systems\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: SQL experience is a plus but not required\\\\n\\\\nOptions: SQL, SQL Server, database, MySQL, use databases, PostgreSQL, Oracle Relational Database, data warehouse, database management systems, use query languages, query languages, manage database, Microsoft Access, operate relational database management system, database development tools, maintain database, data analytics, Teradata Database, CA Datacom/DB, business intelligence, Solidity, SPARQL, search databases, database quality standards, perform data mining, perform records management, data models, data mining, Drupal, maintain database performance, create data models, NoSQL, create database diagrams, manage quantitative data, implement data warehousing techniques, develop data processing applications, PHP, accounting, C#, design database scheme, SAP Data Services, DB2, use logic programming, manage data, data storage, balance database resources, SAS Data Management, perform data analysis, use accounting systems, use data processing techniques\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as beneficial for the job vacancy. The vacancy mentions \\\\\"SQL experience is a plus but not required,\\\\\" which suggests that while SQL skills are advantageous, they are not a mandatory requirement for the job. Therefore, we should focus on skills related to SQL and databases, as these are the most relevant to the statement provided.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: Skills: SQL, use databases, use query languages, query languages, manage database, database management systems, operate relational database management system, maintain database, create data models, manage data\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: Be able to drive technological advances and increase expertise level in the department\\\\n\\\\nOptions: category specific expertise, training  subject expertise, analyse your expertise, develop technological improvement strategies, demonstrate disciplinary expertise, identify technological needs, monitor developments in field of expertise, primitive technology, provide technical expertise, computer technology, provide technical training, monitor technology trends, business knowledge, keep updated on innovations in various business fields, apply knowledge of science technology and engineering, provide training on technological business developments, anticipate change in car technology, identify skills gaps, adapt to changes in technological development plans, patents, assess employees\\' capability levels, describe chemical innovation in products, carpentry, liaise with industry experts, identify training needs, keep up with trends, coordinate technological activities, keep up-to-date to computer trends, biotechnology, monitor sociological trends, levels of software testing, assess your competences for artistic coaching, innovate in ICT, adult education, special needs education, natural history, keep up with innovations in food manufacturing, think innovately, history, seek innovation in current practices, social innovation, apply context specific clinical competences, innovation in nursing, apply specialised veterinary knowledge, socio-economic trends in your sector, occupational science, study craft trends, cooperate with professionals, liaise with engineers, economics\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706652490.0030627}
