ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a transudative pleural effusion with positive Cryptococcal antigen and culture. We describe a 32-year-old male with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) who presented to an outside hospital with dyspnea and a large pleural effusion. An initial pleural fluid analysis was positive for Cryptococcal Ag. However, the infection was eventually found to be widespread as he had positive Cryptococcal Ag and cultures in his pleural fluid, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). His antimicrobial regiment was escalated from fluconazole to amphotericin B and flucytosine. His medical condition deteriorated, and the patient passed away. Due to its rarity and range of clinical severity, diagnosis of disseminated Cryptococcosis can be delayed. We present this case to bring awareness of this diagnosis as a differential in immunocompromised patients regardless of a transudative pleural effusion. TEXT: pmc1 Introduction Cryptococcus is a fungal spore that causes infections, particularly in HIV positive and immunocompromised patients. Cryptococcus is an encapsulated yeast found in the environment. The fungus commonly infects the lungs resulting in pneumonia or the central nervous system, causing meningitis [1]. However, the fungus can disseminate to many different organs. Infrequently, individuals with diabetes mellitus, liver disease, kidney disease, and even no known medical history can have disseminated infection [[1], [2], [3]]. Individuals who are HIV-negative with ESLD have significantly higher mortality than HIV-negative patients without ESLD or HIV positive patients. This higher mortality is likely related to the liver\\'s important role in generating an effective immune response, clearing cytokines and bacteria from the vasculature [4]. In patients with ESLD, this response is compromised and results in an increased risk of Cryptococcal meningitis and disseminated disease [3]. Cryptococcal meningitis is a disease with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in cases with disseminated infection. The presence of either of these conditions demands an aggressive treatment regimen with amphotericin B and flucytosine, while milder infections, such as pulmonary Cryptococcosis, can be adequately managed with fluconazole [5]. Cryptococcal infection in the lungs usually causes an exudative effusion [[6], [7], [8]]. In our literature review, we have not found a case of an individual with a transudative effusion who had Cryptococcal pneumonia or Cryptococcal pleural infection.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Pneumonia, Diabetes mellitus, Liver disorder, Pneumonitis, Meningitis, Renal disorder, Nephropathy, Cryptococcosis, Disseminated cryptococcosis, Hepatic failure, Drug-induced liver injury, Hepatic function abnormal, HIV infection, Sepsis, Renal impairment, Meningitis aseptic, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Lung consolidation, Organising pneumonia, Pneumonia cryptococcal, Meningitis noninfective, Hepatitis, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Renal failure, Hepatobiliary disease, HIV infection CDC Group III, Liver injury, HIV infection CDC Group IV subgroup A, Meningitis cryptococcal, HIV infection CDC group IV, HIV infection CDC Group IV subgroup E, Hepatic lesion, Arachnoiditis, Meningism, HIV infection CDC Group IV subgroup D, Cryptococcal cutaneous infection, HIV infection CDC Group IV subgroup C1, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, HIV infection CDC Group I, Type 3 diabetes mellitus, HIV infection CDC Group IV subgroup B, Hyperglycaemia, HIV infection CDC Group II, Pneumonia bacterial, HIV infection CDC Group IV subgroup C2, Fungal infection, Pachymeningitis, Hepatotoxicity, Acute kidney injury, Meningitis bacterial\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
