ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Impact of Pharmacogenomic Information on Values of Care and Quality of Life Associated with Codeine and Tramadol-Related Adverse Drug Events. ABSTRACT: To assess the potential impact of Pharmacogenomic (PGx) variation in cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) enzyme function, using loss in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) associated with treatment problems, and the willingness to pay to avoid treatment problems from patients\\' and payers\\' perspectives. The study included patients prescribed tramadol or codeine, or both, between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2017. Demographic information and adverse drug events, including adverse drug events and poor pain control, were collected from the electronic health records using natural language processing techniques and review by trained abstractors. Patients\\' willingness to pay and QALY estimates were based on comprehensive literature review. The CYP2D6 phenotypes were divided into 4 groups: ultra-rapid metabolizers, normal metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers. Among the 2860 identified patients, 63 (2%) were ultrarapid metabolizers, 1449 (50%) were normal metabolizers, 1155 (40%) were intermediate metabolizers, and 193 (7%) were poor metabolizers. The patients\\' average estimated willingness-to-pay value to avoid treatment problems was $23 per month; poor metabolizers developed problems with the highest estimated willingness-to-pay value ($32 per month). The mean QALY loss among all patients was 0.024 QALYs (8.8 healthy days); poor metabolizers had the highest loss (0.027 QALYs, 9.9 healthy days). Patients with various phenotypes developed different treatment problem profiles. Poor CYP2D6 metabolizers developed problems with highest willingness to pay, and they might potentially benefit most from PGx-guided treatment and problem prevention. TEXT: Opioid analgesics are frequently used for management of both acute and chronic pain.1,2 Opioid prescriptions in the United States are common, with a rate of 59 per 100 persons in 2017.3 Codeine and tramadol are two of the most commonly used opioids. Codeine yields adverse effects of gastrointestinal discomfort, vertigo, sleepiness, and rash4; tramadol has been reported to cause nausea, vomiting, fatigue, sedation, sweating, and serotonin toxicity.5,6 Many of these treatment problems, including adverse drug events (ADEs) and poor pain control, are not life-threatening, and they can require limited management by health care providers. Therefore, the direct financial effects of these problems may be limited; however, these problems also affect quality of life, and information quantifying the effects of such outcomes on patient quality of life is lacking.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Nausea, Vomiting, Fatigue, Drug ineffective, Rash, Somnolence, Dizziness, Asthenia, Drug interaction, Sedation, Abdominal pain, Hyperhidrosis, Adverse drug reaction, Abdominal discomfort, Vertigo, Toxicity to various agents, Drug resistance, Diarrhoea, Drug intolerance, Pain, Rash erythematous, Insomnia, Treatment failure, Erythema, Lethargy, Malaise, Overdose, Mental fatigue, Vertigo labyrinthine, Rash maculo-papular, Headache, Cold sweat, Vomiting projectile, Confusional state, Vertigo CNS origin, Adverse event, Vertigo positional, Serotonin syndrome, Adverse reaction, Decreased appetite, Oesophageal discomfort, Muscle fatigue, Condition aggravated, Dyspepsia, Hypersomnia, Compensatory sweating, Gastrointestinal tract irritation, Cervicogenic vertigo, Rash pruritic, Epigastric discomfort\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653952.909855}
