ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: This report highlights azathioprine-induced severe myelosuppression in the patient with NUDT15 minor variant. This case report is particularly instructive because several typical symptoms are the clues to this critical adverse drug reaction. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT 15) gene polymorphism impacts severe myelosuppression even in autoimmune hepatitis patients treated with azathioprine. Massive hair loss and painful oral ulcers allowed early diagnosis of the critical adverse reactions. Azathioprine (AZA) is a part of the standard therapy for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH); however, there are critical adverse effects of AZA, including acute and severe myelosuppression. The genetic polymorphism of nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15) has been proposed as predictive of adverse drug reactions of AZA in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. However, the impact of this genetic variant on AIH is unclear. We herein report the case of an AIH patient\\\\u2014with a homogeneous variant of the minor allele of NUDT 15\\\\u2014who presented with severe myelosuppression induced by AZA, massive hair loss, and painful oral ulcer, which allowed the diagnosis of an adverse drug reaction. 2 CASE REPORT A 65\\\\u2010year\\\\u2010old woman who was serologically and histologically diagnosed with AIH at 49 years old had been receiving ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and prednisolone (PSL) treatment. She also took allopurinol because of hyperuricemia. The PSL dose was commenced at 30 mg per day (0.6 mg per kg per day) and was gradually tapered. After reducing PSL to 6.0 mg per day, combination therapy with 50 mg of AZA (1 mg per kg body weight) was commenced. Three weeks after AZA administration, she noticed massive hair loss (Figure 1), stomatitis (Figure 2), and purpura (Figure 3). Blood examination revealed agranulocytosis, macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and inflammation. She was therefore hospitalized for further examination and medical treatment. The details of the laboratory test were as follows (Table 1): white blood cell count =840/\\\\u03bcl, neutrophil =2.5%, eosinophil =2.0%, basophil =0.0%, lymphocyte =95.5%, hemoglobin =10.9 g/dl, platelet count = 9.0 \\\\u00d7104/\\\\u03bcl, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) = 21.7 mg/dl, creatinine = 1.20 mg/dl, uric acid =3.9 mg/dl, total protein = 7.5 g/dl, albumin =4.3 g/dl, total bilirubin = 0.5 mg/dl, lactate dehydrogenase (LD) = 147 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) = 19 U/L, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =11 U/L, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) =58 U/L, gamma\\\\u2010glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) = 25 U/L, cholinesterase =34.2 U/L, prothrombin time =140%, IgG =1082 mg/dL, C\\\\u2010reactive protein (CRP) =12.44 mg/dL, and anti\\\\u2010nuclear antibody (ANA) = 40 times.
