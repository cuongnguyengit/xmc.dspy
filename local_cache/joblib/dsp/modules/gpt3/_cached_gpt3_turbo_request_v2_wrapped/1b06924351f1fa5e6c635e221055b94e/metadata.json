ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\\\\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\\\\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\\\\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \\\\u201cI think I\\\\u2019m having a stroke.\\\\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\\\\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Hypokalaemia, Anxiety, Hypomagnesaemia, Blood pressure increased, Hypotension, Hyponatraemia, Alcohol abuse, Hyperkalaemia, Hypocalcaemia, Alcohol use disorder, Blood potassium decreased, Alcoholism, Alcohol problem, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Drug abuse, Alcohol use, Anxiety disorder, Labile hypertension, Malignant hypertension, Hypokalaemic syndrome, Panic reaction, Alcoholic, Hypertensive urgency, Essential hypertension, Hypermagnesaemia, Nervousness, Urine potassium decreased, Alcohol poisoning, Panic disorder, Fear, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Alcoholic psychosis, Panic attack, Hypertensive angiopathy, Orthostatic hypertension, Generalised anxiety disorder, Alkalosis hypokalaemic, Electrolyte imbalance, Phobia, Alcoholic coma, Blood magnesium decreased, Idiosyncratic alcohol intoxication, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Renal hypertension, Blood alcohol, Prehypertension\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an interstitial pneumonia caused by an immunological reaction to the chronic inhalation of an antigen. Little is known, however, about the pathological change of the pulmonary lesions. A 33-year-old man was diagnosed with chronic bird-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis based on the findings of a surgical lung biopsy and an inhalation provocation test. He underwent lung transplantation at 8 years after the diagnosis because of disease progression. We conclude that the analysis of the explant suggests that the presence of extensive fibrosis in the centrilobular and perilobular area with bridging fibrosis is a form of pathological progression of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. TEXT: Introduction Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an interstitial pneumonia caused by an immunological reaction to an inhaled antigen. Clinically, HP is divided into acute and chronic forms. In chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP), the fibrotic process progresses for more than 6 months (1). The precise diagnosis of CHP is always difficult because radiologic data and other clinical findings mimic the clinical picture of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) (2, 3). Pathological findings from surgical lung biopsy (SLB) and autopsy are therefore important for exploring the diagnosis. In the pathological observation of SLB, chronic bronchiolitis with granulomatous inflammation and bronchiolocentric distribution, in addition to perilobular fibrosis, is suggestive of CHP rather than IIPs (4). Autopsy findings also shed light on the progression of fibrosis caused by CHP (5, 6). Although the autopsy lung findings reveal the progression of CHP, the effects of terminal events, such as bacterial and fungal infection or diffuse alveolar damage are superimposed on those specimens. We hereby describe a case of CHP that was treated with lung transplantation. The specimens obtained from the explanted lung revealed how the pathological changes progressed over an 8-year period.
