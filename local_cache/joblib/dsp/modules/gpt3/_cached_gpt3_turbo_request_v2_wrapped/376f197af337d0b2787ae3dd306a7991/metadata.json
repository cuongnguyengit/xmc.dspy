ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Mass vaccination campaigns are being run all over the globe to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. There have been several reports of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) occurrence following COVID-19 vaccination. However, ITP due to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been rarely reported, and a causal link has not been identified. The pathophysiology behind immune thrombocytopenia is similar to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. The management is also similar to other secondary immune thrombocytopenia. We present a case of a 67-year old female diagnosed with immune thrombocytopenia following Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination. The treatment was resistant to high-dose steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and rituximab and eventually responded to a thrombopoietin-stimulating agent. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, by the WHO. As of July 10, 2021, there have been 33,604,986 total reported cases and 603,958 deaths in the United States [1]. Mass vaccination campaigns are being run all over the world to combat the pandemic. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (US-FDA) has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen COVID-19 vaccines, under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The US-FDA gave the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine EUA on December 11, 2020, for individuals 16 years or older. The EUA was expanded to include adolescents between 12 and 15 years on May 10, 2021 [2]. As of July 10, 2021, 184,469,317 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines and a total of 332,966,409 vaccines have been administered in the US [1]. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is an mRNA vaccine coated in a lipid that encodes the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) spike glycoprotein. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an immune-mediated disease defined by isolated thrombocytopenia (peripheral blood platelet count < 100,000/uL) [3]. When other causes or diseases that have led to the condition are not identified, it is termed primary ITP. In contrast, secondary ITP refers to immune thrombocytopenia due to underlying conditions or drugs [3]. Various viral diseases like the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Varicella-Zoster virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Zika virus, and various autoimmune diseases like systemic Lupus Erythematosus have been associated with secondary ITP. The annual incidence of adult immune thrombocytopenia is around 3.3 per 100,000 in the US [4]. We present a case of a 67-year-old female who presented with ITP following the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
