ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

Could blood-brain barrier be a disease \\\\\"sanctuary\\\\\" during venetoclax treatment? ABSTRACT: Our unique case of Richter\\'s Transformation presenting as leptomeningial infiltration in a CLL patient receiving venetoclax raises questions on whether the drug penetrates the blood-brain barrier and at what extend, especially in reduced doses given for drug-drug interactions. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION We present a unique Richter\\'s transformation case in CNS with identical to CLL clonal origin, in a patient treated with venetoclax. With our case, we make implications on whether venetoclax penetrates the blood\\\\u2010brain barrier and we address the debating issue of the appropriate venetoclax dose in case of drug\\\\u2010drug interactions. Richter\\'s transformation (RT) is the development of high\\\\u2010grade non\\\\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma or Hodgkin disease in patients with a previous or concomitant diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma(SLL). 1 Clinical features associated with RT include systemic symptoms (59%), progressive lymphadenopathy (64%), extranodal involvement (41%), elevation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (82%), and monoclonal gammopathy(44%). Systemic symptoms include fever, weight loss, and/or drenching night sweats. 2 Most (80%) RT cases presenting as high\\\\u2010grade B\\\\u2010cell non\\\\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma have the same clonal origin with the underling CLL/SLL and only 20% arise from a different clone. 3 , 4 The knowledge of clonal relationship between the non\\\\u2010Hodgkin lymphoma and CLL is important because the prognosis varies; when the clonal origin is identical, survival is reported to be very short (8\\\\u201014 months), but when it is different, survival is reported to be comparable to that of patients with de novo diffuse large B\\\\u2010cell lymphoma(DLBCL). 3 Richter\\'s transformation occurs in approximately 2%\\\\u201010% of CLL patients during their disease course, with a transformation rate of 0.5%\\\\u20101% per year. 5 Risk factors associated with RT include clinical characteristics (eg, Rai stage), genetic CLL characteristics (eg, BCL\\\\u20102 germ line polymorphisms, NOTCH\\\\u20101 mutations, TP53 disruption), biological CLL characteristics (eg, IgVH mutational status), and type of therapy. 3 , 4 , 5 There are no data to support that novel agents (B\\\\u2010cell receptor\\\\u2010BCR\\\\u2010inhibitors or BCL\\\\u20102 inhibitor) are associated with increased RT incidence in comparison with chemotherapy/chemoimmunotherapy. 6 , 7 , 8 However, in all published clinical\\\\u2010trial and real\\\\u2010world data with these new agents, RT typically appears early, within 1 year of the treatment initiation. 6 , 7 , 8 Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is rare in RT 2 with unknown definite incidence, since the only existing data are case reports. Half of these cases present as leptomeningeal infiltration. 9 , 10 , 11\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Drug interaction, Drug ineffective, Drug resistance, Toxicity to various agents, Drug-disease interaction, Richter\\'s syndrome, Potentiating drug interaction, Off label use, Labelled drug-drug interaction medication error, Overdose, Inhibitory drug interaction, Drug intolerance, Drug-device interaction, Drug level increased, Leptomeningeal myelomatosis, Product use in unapproved indication, Paradoxical drug reaction, Blood brain barrier defect, Arachnoiditis, Meningitis, Pachymeningitis, Meningitis aseptic, Plasma cell myeloma, Haematological malignancy, Adverse drug reaction, Meningism, Leukaemia, Chronic myeloid leukaemia transformation, Chronic leukaemia, Therapeutic agent-diagnostic test interaction, Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (in remission), Meningitis noninfective, Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia transformation, Myeloblastoma, Treatment failure, Chronic myeloid leukaemia (in remission), Chronic leukaemia in remission, Drug level above therapeutic, Therapeutic product effect incomplete, Bone marrow leukaemic cell infiltration, Leukaemic infiltration, Drug ineffective for unapproved indication, Drug abuse, Plasma cell leukaemia, Chronic myeloid leukaemia, Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, Meningoradiculitis, Alcohol interaction, Leukaemic infiltration extramedullary, Leukaemia granulocytic\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
