ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Infective endocarditis caused by Salmonella enteritidis in a dialysis patient: a case report and literature review. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Infective endocarditis is significantly more common in haemodialysis patients as compared with the general population, the causative pathogen is generally Staphylococcus aureus; there have been no previously reported cases of infective endocarditis caused by a Salmonella species in haemodialysis patients. METHODS We report the case of a 68 year-old woman on haemodialysis who developed infective endocarditis as a result of Salmonella enteritidis. Although we treated the patient with ceftriaxone combined with ciprofloxacin, infective endocarditis was not detected early enough and unfortunately developed into cerebral septic emboli, which ultimately resulted in death. CONCLUSIONS Although there are several reports that Salmonella endocarditis without cardiac failure can be successfully treated with antibiotics alone, early surgical intervention is essential for some cases to prevent life-threatening complications. Transesophageal echocardiography should be performed in any patient with high clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case-report of Salmonella endocarditis in a haemodialysis patient. TEXT: Background Infective endocarditis is significantly more common in haemodialysis patients as compared with the general population. In addition to the four conventional categories of infective endocarditis (native valve infective endocarditis, prosthetic valve infective endocarditis, infective endocarditis in intravenous drug users, and nosocomial infective endocarditis), a fifth category, health-care associated infective endocarditis or haemodialysis associated infective endocarditis, has recently been proposed. Although infective endocarditis is a common complication among haemodialysis patients, the causative pathogen is generally Staphylococcus aureus; there have been no reported cases of infective endocarditis caused by a Salmonella species in haemodialysis patients. Salmonella species have been reported to cause bacteremia [1] and infective endocarditis in 5 and 1.4% of patients [2] during gastrointestinal infections, respectively. However, in general, cases of infective endocarditis due to Salmonella species are relatively rare. Here, we report the case of a 68 year-old woman on haemodialysis who developed infective endocarditis on her native mitral valve as a result of Salmonella enteritidis. After hospitalization, the patient was treated with intensive antibiotic therapy. However, the infective endocarditis was not detected early enough and unfortunately developed into cerebral septic emboli, which ultimately resulted in death.
