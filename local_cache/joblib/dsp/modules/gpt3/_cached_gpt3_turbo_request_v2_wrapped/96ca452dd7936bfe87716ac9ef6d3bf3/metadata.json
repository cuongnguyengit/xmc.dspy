ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\\\\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: Introduction.Staphylococcus caprae is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that has been reported in several cases as a human pathogen. However, it has rarely been reported as pathogen in native bone. Furthermore, the reported MIC levels noted in the literature for vancomycin were <2 \\\\u00b5g ml-1making vancomycin a first line choice for infected patients. Case presentation. We report a case of Staphylococcus caprae causing osteomyelitis of the lumbar spine and bacteraemia and resulting in sepsis and ultimately the demise of a patient despite appropriate prolonged antibiotic therapy. Conclusion.Staphylococcus caprae has been reported as a human pathogen since 1983 when it was discovered. We report a case involving native bone infection which is rare in the absence of mechanical hardware. Furthermore, this strain had an elevated MIC for vancomycin which has not been reported in the literature.

Introduction Staphylococcus caprae is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that was first described in 1983 after being isolated from goats where it causes mastitis [1\\\\u20134]. S. caprae typically colonizes human skin, nose and nails and since 1983 it has been reported in several cases as a human pathogen causing peritonitis, meningitis, urinary tract infections, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, prosthetic joint infections, recurrent sepsis, bacteraemia and osteomyelitis [4\\\\u20139]. Many risk factors for S. caprae have begun to emerge and include immunosuppression, diabetes, chronic renal failure, obesity, open or traumatic fractures and contact with sheep or goats [4, 6]. Importantly, several strains of S. caprae have been noted to produce toxic shock syndrome toxin and carry the gene mecA important for methicillin resistance, and have been noted to form a biofilm in vitro on prostheses or bone thought to be due to the presence of the gene altC in combination with the ica operon [1, 4, 6, 10]. Very few cases of S. caprae bone and joint infection occur in native bone and joints without prostheses, and there are few cases of bacteraemia not associated with line infections. In this case report we present Staphylococcus caprae infection of native vertebrae with resulting bacteraemia and ultimately failure of therapy, and summarize the current case reports of infection with this organism.
