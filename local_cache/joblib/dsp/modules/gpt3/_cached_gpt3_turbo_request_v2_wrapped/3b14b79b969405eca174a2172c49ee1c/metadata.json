ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Clinical experience with biologic treatment in resistant eosinophilic fasciitis: Case reports and review of the literature. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Eosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is an uncommon connective tissue disorder characterized by limb and trunk erythema, with symmetrical thickening of the skin. Its pathogenesis is poorly understood. Treatment consists mainly of glucocorticoids. Yet, no randomized trials have evaluated therapies for this rare disease and the optimal treatment modality remains unclear. Although most patients show partial or complete response to glucocorticoids, many relapse upon drug tapering, while others either do not respond at all or fail to sustain prolonged remission. Second-line therapy for this rare disorder includes mainly methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine, cyclosporine and hydroxychloroquine. Recently, several attempts using rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) have shown good clinical results. The three patients had good clinical response to glucocorticoid treatment, followed by disease flare when the drug dose was tapered. Adding methotrexate in all patients and azathioprine to patient 3 did not lead to remission. EF was diagnosed in all patients based on clinical presentation accompanied by fascia biopsy that demonstrated eosinophilic fasciitis. METHODS The patients were successfully treated with rituximab or IVIG, achieving sustained remission. RESULTS The three cases had good clinical response to glucocorticoid treatment, followed by disease flare when the drug dose was tapered. The patients were then successfully treated with rituximab or IVIG, achieving sustained remission. CONCLUSIONS This review of three cases of EF supports the results of previous reports, suggesting addition of rituximab and IVIG is an effective treatment for patients with refractory disease.
