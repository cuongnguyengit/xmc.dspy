ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\\\\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\\\\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\\\\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \\\\u201cI think I\\\\u2019m having a stroke.\\\\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\\\\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Hypokalaemia, Anxiety, Hypomagnesaemia, Blood pressure increased, Hypotension, Hyponatraemia, Alcohol abuse, Hyperkalaemia, Hypocalcaemia, Alcohol use disorder, Blood potassium decreased, Alcoholism, Alcohol problem, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Drug abuse, Alcohol use, Anxiety disorder, Labile hypertension, Malignant hypertension, Hypokalaemic syndrome, Panic reaction, Alcoholic, Hypertensive urgency, Essential hypertension, Hypermagnesaemia, Nervousness, Urine potassium decreased, Alcohol poisoning, Panic disorder, Fear, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Alcoholic psychosis, Panic attack, Hypertensive angiopathy, Orthostatic hypertension, Generalised anxiety disorder, Alkalosis hypokalaemic, Electrolyte imbalance, Phobia, Alcoholic coma, Blood magnesium decreased, Idiosyncratic alcohol intoxication, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Renal hypertension, Blood alcohol, Prehypertension\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \\\\\"found down\\\\\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \\\\u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \\\\u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\\\\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\\\\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \\\\u201ccatch up\\\\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Insomnia, Compartment syndrome, Crush syndrome, Somnolence, Acute kidney injury, Fatigue, Sleep disorder, Sleep deficit, Poor quality sleep, Sleep inertia, Sleep terror, Irregular sleep phase, Behavioural induced insufficient sleep syndrome, Middle insomnia, Parasomnia, Dyssomnia, Terminal insomnia, Abnormal sleep-related event, Abdominal compartment syndrome, Delayed sleep phase, Psychophysiologic insomnia, Paradoxical insomnia, Advanced sleep phase, Somnambulism, Crush injury, Sleep attacks, Sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, Hyposomnia, Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, Orbital compartment syndrome, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition insomnia type, Condition aggravated, Initial insomnia, Irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition parasomnia type, Hypersomnia, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition mixed type, Myalgia, Bedridden, Behavioural insomnia of childhood, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition hypersomnia type, Decompression sickness, Breathing-related sleep disorder, Loss of dreaming, Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Rapid eye movements sleep abnormal, Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Lethargy, Crushing injury of trunk, Sudden onset of sleep\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: To assess the efficacy of biologic drugs, beyond tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) \\\\u03b1 inhibitors, in the management of noninfectious refractory scleritis, either idiopathic or associated with systemic immune-mediated disorders. Patients and Methods. This is a retrospective study assessing the efficacy of several biologic agents (rituximab, anakinra, tocilizumab, and abatacept) and the small molecule tofacitinib in the treatment of scleritis through assessment of scleral inflammation and relapses, as well as treatment impact on best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and safety profile. Fourteen patients (19 eyes) were enrolled in the study. Scleritis inflammatory grading significantly improved from baseline to 3 months (p = 0.002) and from baseline to the last follow-up visit (p = 0.002). Scleritis relapses significantly decreased between the 12 months preceding and following biologic therapy (p = 0.007). No differences regarding BCVA were observed (p = 0.67). Regarding adverse events, only one patient developed pneumonia and septic shock under rituximab treatment. Our results, though limited to a low number of patients, highlight the effectiveness of different biologic therapies in the treatment of noninfectious refractory scleritis, showing to control scleral inflammation and allowing a significant reduction in the number of relapses. TEXT: 1. Introduction Noninfectious scleritis is a severe inflammatory disease of the white outer coating of the eye frequently associated with underlying systemic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, relapsing polychondritis, and systemic vasculitides [1, 2]. The most aggressive forms of scleritis, such as necrotizing scleritis and posterior scleritis, represent conditions at high risk of serious functional and anatomical sequelae. The most dreaded complication of scleritis is perforation, which can lead to loss of the eye [1]. Moreover, damage to contiguous inflamed ocular structures such as cornea, uvea, and retina may also occur and leave permanent scarring responsible for irreversible visual impairment. Early diagnosis in these cases is paramount, as aggressive treatment with systemic high-dose glucocorticoids (GCs) in the acute phase and long-term conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) on the long term is required [1]. In refractory and most severe cases, several biologics have been employed to control scleral inflammation. Among biologic agents, tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) \\\\u03b1 inhibitors have shown to induce a complete and rapid control of scleral inflammation within a few weeks from the start of treatment [3, 4]. Beyond TNF-\\\\u03b1 inhibition, a prospective randomized double-masked trial by Suhler et al. found that the anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody rituximab is effective and well tolerated during a 24-week follow-up period [5]. However, only small case series or isolated case reports have been reported on the use of\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Scleritis, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Drug ineffective, Biotherapy, Uveitis, Infective scleritis, Rheumatoid scleritis, Scleral disorder, Scleritis allergic, Endophthalmitis, Episcleritis, Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Necrotising scleritis, Blood corticosterone, Eye inflammation, Thrombocytopenia, Scleral hyperaemia, Immune-mediated adverse reaction, Panophthalmitis, Treatment failure, Scleral degeneration, Immune system disorder, Acute kidney injury, Blebitis, Immune-mediated arthritis, Non-infectious endophthalmitis, Scleral oedema, Immune enhancement therapy, Immunosuppression, Cytokine release syndrome, Adrenocortical steroid therapy, Immune-mediated dermatitis, Iritis, Scleral thinning, Immune-mediated renal disorder, Scleral deposits, Iridocyclitis, Immune-mediated hepatitis, Anterior chamber inflammation, Immunomodulatory therapy, Loeffler\\'s syndrome, Multi-organ disorder, Hypersensitivity, Scleral discolouration, Keratitis sclerosing, Systemic immune activation, Neoadjuvant therapy, Immune-mediated myositis, Type III immune complex mediated reaction, Scleral reinforcement\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
