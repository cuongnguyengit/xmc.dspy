ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Fatal Hepatitis C after Chemotherapy in a Patient with Malignant Lymphoma: Possible Reactivation of Seronegative Occult Hepatitis C Virus Infection Due to Chemotherapy. ABSTRACT: A 79-year-old man with lymphoma who tested negative for anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody received rituximab-containing chemotherapy. Liver dysfunction of unknown cause had persisted since the second cycle of chemotherapy. Ten months after treatment, he rapidly developed massive ascites and atrophy of the liver, and we detected HCV RNA in his serum using real time polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, medical interviews showed that the patient had no episodes for acute HCV infection, but he did have a history of unspecified liver dysfunction. These findings support the possibility of the reactivation of seronegative occult HCV infection due to chemotherapy in a cancer patient. TEXT: Introduction Chemotherapy using cytotoxic agents and targeted antibodies has helped prolong the cancer patient survival in recent years (1-4). However, since many chemotherapeutic drugs are metabolised in the liver and directly hepatotoxic (5), chemotherapy can cause liver injury, which sometimes leads to a poor clinical outcome. The severity of adverse effects on the liver caused by antineoplastic agents depends on the age, gender, genetic susceptibility, concomitant medications, tumour involvement in the liver and preexisting liver diseases, such as fatty liver, chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis (6). In particular, cancer patients with hepatitis viruses have to be carefully treated with chemotherapy, as their impaired hepatic function sometimes precludes the administration of anticancer drugs in standard doses or intervals (7). A major issue that must be considered when treating hepatitis virus-positive cancer patients is the influence of drugs commonly used in cancer treatments on the clinical outcomes of these patients (8). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation is an established complication occurring among HBV-positive cancer patients treated with chemotherapeutic drugs (9). Reactivation of HBV replication can become severe, resulting in liver failure and death in some cases. In addition, reactivation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) due to immunosuppressive treatment has also been reported in the literature, although data on the clinical outcomes in cancer patients with HCV receiving such treatment have been controversial (10). Occult HCV infection (OCI), which was first reported by two different research groups approximately at the same time in 2004 (11,12), is a newly recognised mode of HCV infection (13,14). In individuals with OCI, HCV RNA is undetectable in serum using standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR), whereas HCV is latent in the liver, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and/or ultracentrifuged serum (11,12,15,16).\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Death, Hepatic failure, Ascites, Hepatic function abnormal, Acute hepatic failure, Acute kidney injury, Hepatitis C, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Hepatic enzyme increased, Alanine aminotransferase increased, Hepatic atrophy, Renal failure, Cardiac arrest, Liver disorder, Clinical death, Drug-induced liver injury, Renal impairment, Hepatitis B reactivation, Sudden death, Aspartate aminotransferase increased, Liver function test abnormal, Hepatotoxicity, Transaminases increased, Acute on chronic liver failure, Cytomegalovirus infection reactivation, Acute hepatitis C, Liver function test increased, Condition aggravated, Hepatorenal failure, Chronic hepatitis C, Urinary ascites, Haemorrhagic ascites, Malignant ascites, Pleural effusion, Cytomegalovirus infection, Cardiac death, Hepatitis viral, Hepatitis E, Pericardial effusion, Liver injury, Subacute hepatic failure, Apparent death, Liver function test decreased, Hepatitis B, Disease progression, Chronic hepatic failure, Biliary ascites, Hepatitis, Terminal state, Hepatitis H\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
