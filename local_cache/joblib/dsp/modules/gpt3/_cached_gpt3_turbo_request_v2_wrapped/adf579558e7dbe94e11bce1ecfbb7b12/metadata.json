ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Optimal management of intrauterine infection to avoid serious adverse perinatal outcomes entails prompt administration of antibiotics and consideration of early delivery of the fetus to remove the focus of infection. We report an unusual case of preterm chorioamnionitis which did not improve with sensitive antibiotics, or delivery of the fetus, and ultimately required an emergency hysterectomy to save the mother\\'s life. Interestingly, subsequent histopathological analysis of the post-hysterectomy specimen did not reveal myometrial necrosis or infectious microorganisms. The placental pathological examination, on the other hand, showed evidence of necrotising chorioamnionitis accompanied by a rarely reported lesion: acute villitis with abundant intravascular Escherichia coli, a finding which is strongly associated with fetal demise and adverse maternal outcomes. TEXT: Introduction Acute intrauterine infection is an important contributor to adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. Clinically, it manifests as feto-maternal tachycardia, pyrexia, uterine tenderness, maternal leucocytosis and/or foul-smelling purulent fluid or discharge from the cervical os.1 Suspected acute intrauterine infection can be confirmed in pregnant women by objective pre- and postnatal laboratory findings, including pathological examination of the placenta.2 Histologically, acute intrauterine infection comprises a: 1) maternal inflammatory response (MIR) demonstrated by the presence of neutrophilic infiltration in chorion and/or amnion in the fetal membranes and/or in the chorionic plate (acute chorioamnionitis); with or without a 2) fetal inflammatory response (FIR) demonstrated by the presence of neutrophilic infiltration in umbilical vessels with or without Wharton substance involvement and infiltration in chorionic plate vessels.3,4 Acute villitis, defined as the presence of neutrophilic infiltration in fetal villous capillaries and stroma, is an uncommon histological entity which may occur in isolation or accompanied by chorioamnionitis, and normally indicates severe fetal sepsis. Rarely, it may be accompanied by an abundance of microorganisms in the fetal vessels of the chorionic villi.5,6 In this paper, we report a rare case of severe maternal sepsis caused by necrotising preterm chorioamnionitis with acute villitis and intravascular microorganisms which only responded to hysterectomy.
