The vacancy mentions a degree in \\\\\"Production Mechanical Electrical Marine Engineering (or similar)\\\\\" and the candidate might be \\\\\"newly educated.\\\\\" This suggests that the job requires a foundational understanding of engineering principles, particularly in the fields mentioned. Since the candidate might be newly educated, we can infer that the job may not require extensive experience but rather a solid educational background in the relevant engineering disciplines. We should look for skills that are related to mechanical, electrical, and marine engineering, as well as general engineering competencies that a recent graduate might possess.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: marine engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, operate mechanical equipment of ships, manage ship electrical systems, operate ship equipment, maintain shipboard machinery, maritime transportation technology, offshore constructions and facilities, provide support in vessel machinery systems\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: SQL experience is a plus but not required\\\\n\\\\nOptions: SQL, SQL Server, database, MySQL, use databases, PostgreSQL, Oracle Relational Database, data warehouse, database management systems, use query languages, query languages, manage database, Microsoft Access, operate relational database management system, database development tools, maintain database, data analytics, Teradata Database, CA Datacom/DB, business intelligence, Solidity, SPARQL, search databases, database quality standards, perform data mining, perform records management, data models, data mining, Drupal, maintain database performance, create data models, NoSQL, create database diagrams, manage quantitative data, implement data warehousing techniques, develop data processing applications, PHP, accounting, C#, design database scheme, SAP Data Services, DB2, use logic programming, manage data, data storage, balance database resources, SAS Data Management, perform data analysis, use accounting systems, use data processing techniques\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as beneficial for the job vacancy. The vacancy mentions \\\\\"SQL experience is a plus but not required,\\\\\" which suggests that while SQL skills are advantageous, they are not a mandatory requirement for the job. Therefore, we should focus on skills related to SQL and databases, as these are the most relevant to the statement provided.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: Skills: SQL, use databases, use query languages, query languages, manage database, database management systems, operate relational database management system, maintain database, create data models, manage data\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: Knowledge about LEAN Value stream Mapping Process Mapping ( production or development ) Competencies\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Lean project management, lean manufacturing, Process-based management, business processes, business process modelling, prepare timelines for pipeline development projects, keep up with digital transformation of industrial processes, create business process models, analyse business processes, Waterfall development, improve business processes, manage all process engineering activities, manage workflow processes, analyse route possibilities in pipeline projects, ICT process quality models, process loyalty schemes, engineering processes, enhance production workflow, process qualitative information, operations department processes, oversee warehouse value-added activities, set management priorities in pipeline networks, Agile project management, analyse production processes for improvement, manage production changeovers, implement operational business plans, plan manufacturing processes, management department processes, identify process improvements, find your place within the architecture of the production, analyse pipeline database information, innovation processes, identify with the company\\'s goals, quality and cycle time optimisation, apply organisational techniques, identify processes for re-engineering, manage medium term objectives, plan product management, lead technology development of an organisation, plan medium to long term objectives, apply risk management processes, develop manufacturing policies, establish data processes, marketing department processes, business requirements techniques, follow up pipeline integrity management priorities, coordinate manufacturing production activities, analyse information processes, production processes, create designs for pipeline engineering\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed in the job vacancy snippet. The vacancy mentions \\\\\"Knowledge about LEAN Value stream Mapping Process Mapping (production or development) Competencies.\\\\\" This indicates that the job requires an understanding of LEAN methodologies, specifically in the context of value stream and process mapping. These skills are related to improving efficiency in production or development environments. We should look for skills that are associated with LEAN practices, process mapping, and potentially the analysis and improvement of business processes.\\\\n\\\\nSkills:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706652490.1605384}
