ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\\\\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\\\\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\\\\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \\\\u201cI think I\\\\u2019m having a stroke.\\\\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\\\\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Hypokalaemia, Anxiety, Hypomagnesaemia, Blood pressure increased, Hypotension, Hyponatraemia, Alcohol abuse, Hyperkalaemia, Hypocalcaemia, Alcohol use disorder, Blood potassium decreased, Alcoholism, Alcohol problem, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Drug abuse, Alcohol use, Anxiety disorder, Labile hypertension, Malignant hypertension, Hypokalaemic syndrome, Panic reaction, Alcoholic, Hypertensive urgency, Essential hypertension, Hypermagnesaemia, Nervousness, Urine potassium decreased, Alcohol poisoning, Panic disorder, Fear, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Alcoholic psychosis, Panic attack, Hypertensive angiopathy, Orthostatic hypertension, Generalised anxiety disorder, Alkalosis hypokalaemic, Electrolyte imbalance, Phobia, Alcoholic coma, Blood magnesium decreased, Idiosyncratic alcohol intoxication, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Renal hypertension, Blood alcohol, Prehypertension\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Intravenous immunoglobulin is a recognized treatment in recalcitrant autoimmune bullous diseases. Infusions are administered monthly over 1-5 days in the hospital setting and associated with mild to severe infusion-related systemic effects, in part due to the high doses necessary to induce and achieve remission. We present a case series of four patients with bullous diseases treated successfully with low-dose subcutaneous IgG who achieved remission with maintenance therapy. Patient-administered smaller, more frequent doses of IgG into subcutaneous tissue more closely mimics the body\\'s own antibody production and produces a more stable serum trough level. Subcutaneous IgG is a novel treatment approach in bullous diseases which can induce a state remission. TEXT: Introduction Autoimmune bullous diseases are characterized by bullous lesions to the skin and mucous membranes of the oral cavity, nose, eyes, larynx, pharynx, esophagus, and genitals.1 Once considered fatal conditions, treatment options have evolved from corticosteroids to steroid-sparing immunosuppressant drugs (methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine and mycophenolic acid (MMF)), monoclonal antibodies (rituximab), and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).2\\\\u20134 IVIG is a human plasma derivative containing IgG and has been used in conjunction with conventional therapy to treat refractory bullous diseases.2,4 Subcutaneous IgG (SCIG) is an effective alternative for patients refractory to or unable to tolerate immunosuppressive therapy.4 Moreover, it has been shown to be more cost-effective than immunosuppressives, which can result in significant toxicities requiring hospitalization.5 The immunomodulatory effects are complex and multifaceted, including increased catabolism of autoantibodies, inhibition in autoantibody function, and decrease in plasma inflammatory markers.2,3,6 Optimal dosing varies but follows similar conventional weight-based approaches (300\\\\u2013400 mg/kg/month) as well as higher doses (2 g/kg over 2\\\\u20135 days/month) in aggressive disease.2,4,7 Adverse events can be mild (headaches, backaches, hives), severe (anaphylaxis, thromboembolism), and are usually infusion-related and self-limiting. However, adverse events increase with higher doses and may interfere with patient\\\\u2019s quality of life.3,6 The goal of therapy in the bullous diseases is to induce and maintain remission, as evidenced by the cessation of new vesicle and bullae formation and healing of old lesions.3,8 Long-term therapy may be required in recalcitrant disease and may be associated with significant toxicities if corticosteroids or immunosuppressants are needed, particularly in elderly patients with bullous pemphigoid.8 In the present case series, we describe the use of low-dose SCIG (Hizentra; CSL Behring Inc) to safely induce and maintain long-term remissions in four patients\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Off label use, No adverse event, Drug ineffective, Nutritional supplementation, Product used for unknown indication, Non-neutralising antibodies, Ideas of reference, Multimorbidity, Unevaluable investigation, Unevaluable therapy, Therapy non-responder, Nothing by mouth order, Drug interaction, Homeopathy, Interventional procedure, Product use in unapproved indication, Product origin unknown, Decreased activity, Uncircumcised, Collagen antigen type 1, Non-consummation, Neutralising antibodies, Enzyme supplementation, Vegan, Butanol-extractable iodine, Fatigue, Vitamin supplementation, Mineral supplementation, Calcium ionised, Non-tobacco user, Prescription drug used without a prescription, Unevaluable specimen, Vegetarian, Lipoprotein (a), Supplementation therapy, Tangentiality, Unevaluable event, Prothrombin fragment 1.2, Androgens, Monoclonal antibody unconjugated therapy, Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant, Therapeutic agent urine negative, Coagulation factor, Suspected counterfeit product, Therapeutic agent-diagnostic test interaction, Self-medication, Chemotherapeutic drug level therapeutic, Collagen antigen type IV, Abstains from alcohol, Deafness\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653722.940591}
