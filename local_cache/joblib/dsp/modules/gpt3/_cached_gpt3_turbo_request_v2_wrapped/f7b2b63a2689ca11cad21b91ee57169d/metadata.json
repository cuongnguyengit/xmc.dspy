ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: An 82-year-old woman with primary biliary cholangitis was diagnosed with an irreversible neurological disorder, caused by metronidazole (MNZ)-induced encephalopathy. Although the disorder is a reversible pathological condition, in rare cases, it can cause serious sequelae or could even be fatal. Therefore, medications should be administered carefully, particularly in patients who require long-term administration of large doses or those with liver dysfunction. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION Metronidazole (MNZ) is used as a first\\\\u2010line treatment for Clostridium difficile (CD) colitis. MNZ\\\\u2010induced encephalopathy is a relatively rare disease, characterized by a reversible central nervous system disorder. Generally, it is thought that the illness improves upon discontinuing medication. However, a few cases of serious residual sequelae and death have been reported, albeit in small numbers. Similarly, we have found serious residual sequelae caused by MNZ\\\\u2010induced encephalopathy, as reported in this study. 2 CASE PRESENTATION An 82\\\\u2010year\\\\u2010old woman was admitted to our hospital complaining of fevers and nausea for one month. Upon experiencing these symptoms, she consulted her previous doctor, which led to her being diagnosed with pyelonephritis. Levofloxacin was prescribed, and her symptoms improved. However, 14 days prior to hospitalization, she once again started suffering from fevers, as well as passing mushy stool. The previous doctor prescribed MNZ based on a diagnosis of CD enteritis, confirmed by a positive CD toxin test. Consequently, the fever declined; however, the persistent nausea and vomiting led to the hospitalization of the patient. She has a past medical history of primary biliary cholangitis, atrial fibrillation, and interstitial pneumonia. She was taking branched\\\\u2010chain amino acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, kanamycin, spironolactone, lactulose, and apixaban. On physical examination, vital signs were as follows: JCS (Japan coma scale), 0; GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale), 4/5/6; blood pressure, 130/64 mmHg; pulse rate, 68 beats/minute and regular; body temperature, 36.8\\\\u00b0C; peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), 95% (O2 at 2 L/min); no neurological abnormality. Laboratory examinations revealed the following: Blood test: blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 23 mg/dL. Urinalysis: white blood cells 2+, nitrate +, protein 2+. There were no other significant findings.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Pneumonia, Encephalopathy, Atrial fibrillation, Interstitial lung disease, Pyelonephritis, Tubulointerstitial nephritis, Urinary tract infection, Pyelitis, Pneumonitis, Atrial flutter, Pyelonephritis acute, Pyelocystitis, Idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, Pyelonephritis chronic, Toxic encephalopathy, Hepatic encephalopathy, Bacterial pyelonephritis, Acute interstitial pneumonitis, Cardiac fibrillation, Kidney infection, Pulmonary fibrosis, Lung consolidation, Ventricular fibrillation, Supraventricular tachycardia, Leukoencephalopathy, Pyelonephritis viral, Emphysematous pyelonephritis, Nephritis, Metabolic encephalopathy, Encephalitis, Renal abscess, Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, Atrial tachycardia, Arrhythmia supraventricular, Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, Cerebral disorder, Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, Perinephritis, Organising pneumonia, Hyperammonaemic encephalopathy, Nephritis bacterial, Encephalopathy neonatal, Renal cyst infection, Nephropathy, Cognitive disorder, Alveolitis, Cardiac flutter, Alveolar lung disease, Pyelonephritis mycoplasmal\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653505.5174067}
