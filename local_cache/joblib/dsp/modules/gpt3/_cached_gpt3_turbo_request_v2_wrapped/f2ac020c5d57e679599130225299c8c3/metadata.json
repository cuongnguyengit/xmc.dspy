ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\\\\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\\\\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\\\\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \\\\u201cI think I\\\\u2019m having a stroke.\\\\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\\\\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Hypokalaemia, Anxiety, Hypomagnesaemia, Blood pressure increased, Hypotension, Hyponatraemia, Alcohol abuse, Hyperkalaemia, Hypocalcaemia, Alcohol use disorder, Blood potassium decreased, Alcoholism, Alcohol problem, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Drug abuse, Alcohol use, Anxiety disorder, Labile hypertension, Malignant hypertension, Hypokalaemic syndrome, Panic reaction, Alcoholic, Hypertensive urgency, Essential hypertension, Hypermagnesaemia, Nervousness, Urine potassium decreased, Alcohol poisoning, Panic disorder, Fear, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Alcoholic psychosis, Panic attack, Hypertensive angiopathy, Orthostatic hypertension, Generalised anxiety disorder, Alkalosis hypokalaemic, Electrolyte imbalance, Phobia, Alcoholic coma, Blood magnesium decreased, Idiosyncratic alcohol intoxication, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Renal hypertension, Blood alcohol, Prehypertension\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \\\\\"found down\\\\\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \\\\u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \\\\u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\\\\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\\\\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \\\\u201ccatch up\\\\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Insomnia, Compartment syndrome, Crush syndrome, Somnolence, Acute kidney injury, Fatigue, Sleep disorder, Sleep deficit, Poor quality sleep, Sleep inertia, Sleep terror, Irregular sleep phase, Behavioural induced insufficient sleep syndrome, Middle insomnia, Parasomnia, Dyssomnia, Terminal insomnia, Abnormal sleep-related event, Abdominal compartment syndrome, Delayed sleep phase, Psychophysiologic insomnia, Paradoxical insomnia, Advanced sleep phase, Somnambulism, Crush injury, Sleep attacks, Sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, Hyposomnia, Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, Orbital compartment syndrome, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition insomnia type, Condition aggravated, Initial insomnia, Irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition parasomnia type, Hypersomnia, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition mixed type, Myalgia, Bedridden, Behavioural insomnia of childhood, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition hypersomnia type, Decompression sickness, Breathing-related sleep disorder, Loss of dreaming, Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Rapid eye movements sleep abnormal, Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Lethargy, Crushing injury of trunk, Sudden onset of sleep\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE Emergence agitation (EA) is frequently observed in children undergoing general anaesthesia. This study tested whether the addition of an intra-operative low-dose infusion of dexmedetomidine to fentanyl treatment reduced the incidence of emergence delirium following desflurane anesthesia in children undergoing strabismus surgery. METHODS A total of 96 children (1-5 years old) undergoing strabismus surgery were enrolled. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with desflurane. After induction, fentanyl (1 \\\\u03bcg/kg) was administered to all children. During surgery, patients were infused with 0.2 \\\\u03bcg/(kg\\\\u00b7h)\\\\u207b\\\\u00b9 dexmedetomidine (Group FD, n=47) or normal saline (Group F, n=47). Postoperative objective pain score (OPS), Paediatric Agitation and Emergence Delirium (PAED) score, and EA score were documented every 10 minutes in the post-anaesthesia care unit. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the two groups in demographic characteristics and haemodynamic changes. The mean values of maximum EA, maximum PAED, and maximum OPS score were significantly lower in Group FD than in Group F at 0, 10, and 20 minutes after arrival at the post-anaesthesia care unit (p<0.001). The frequency of fentanyl rescue was lower in Group FD than in Group F (p<0.001). The incidence of severe EA was significantly lower in Group FD than in Group F (12.8% vs. 74.5%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Intra-operative low-dose infusion of dexmedetomidine in addition to fentanyl reduces EA following desflurane anaesthesia in children undergoing strabismus surgeries. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Emergence delirium (ED) and emergence agitation (EA) are common phenomenon in paediatric patients undergoing general anaesthesia by inhalation agents. The incidence of ED or EA was reported to range from 18% to 80%.1,2 Agitated behaviour associated with ED can delay discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU), decrease parent and caregiver satisfaction, and increase the overall cost to the institution.3 Risk factors for development of ED include preschool age, previous surgery, adaptability, ophthalmology or otorhinolaryngology procedure, and inhalation agents associated with fast emergence.1,4 Strabismus surgery is one of the most common ophthalmologic operations in children under 5 years old and can be associated with moderate postoperative pain caused by the conjunctiva5 and a high incidence of EA (40-86%).6-9 As this procedure commonly elicits the oculo-cardiac reflex (OCR) by traction on extraocular muscles and their adnexa or by application of sudden pressure to the eye or orbit, arrhythmias such as bradycardia are frequently encountered during the procedure. Therefore, anaesthetic strategies for strabismus surgery in paediatric patients include prevention of haemodynamic instability as well as reduction of postoperative pain and EA.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Confusional state, Delirium, Strabismus correction, Eye muscle operation, Intensive care unit delirium, Somnolence, Agitation, Postoperative delirium, Post-injection delirium sedation syndrome, Acute kidney injury, Confusion postoperative, Oculomotor nerve operation, Delirium tremens, Disorientation, Coma, Vision correction operation, Agitation postoperative, Trochlear nerve operation, Loss of consciousness, Eye operation, Confusional arousal, Orbit plastic repair, Altered state of consciousness, Abducent nerve operation, Delirium febrile, Diplopia correction, Myopia correction, Anaesthetic complication neurological, Orbital decompression, Anaesthetic complication, Stupor, Monovision presbyopia corrective procedure, Sedation complication, Eyelid operation, Ptosis repair, Acute psychosis, Amblyopia therapy, Activation syndrome, Agitation neonatal, Blepharoplasty, Radiation somnolence syndrome, Dizziness, Eye muscle tenotomy, Irritability, Condition aggravated, Premature recovery from anaesthesia, Orbitotomy, Muscle operation, Glaucoma surgery, Eye muscle advancement\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653761.836204}
