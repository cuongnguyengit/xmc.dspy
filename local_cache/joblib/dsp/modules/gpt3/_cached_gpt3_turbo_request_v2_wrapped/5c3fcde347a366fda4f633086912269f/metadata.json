ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Delivery of an Infant with Airway Compression Due to Cystic Hygroma at 37 Weeks\\' Gestation Requiring a Multidisciplinary Decision to Use a Combination of Ex Utero Intrapartum Treatment (EXIT) and Airway Palliation at Cesarean Section. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND This report describes a case of delivery of an infant with airway compression due to cystic hygroma at 37 weeks\\' gestation requiring a multidisciplinary decision to use a combination of ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) and airway palliation at cesarean section. This infant did not require support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). CASE REPORT A 22-year-old G1P0 woman with past medical history of morbid obesity underwent an EXIT procedure due to a large fetal neck mass. Anesthesia included a narcotic-only single-shot spinal, total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) was used for maintenance, and high-dose volatile anesthetics and nitroglycerin infusion was used for complete uterine relaxation. The infant\\'s airway was secured by the otolaryngologist, after which delivery was completed. Sevoflurane and nitroglycerin were discontinued and the previous TIVA was restarted. Uterotonics were aggressively administered to prevent uterine atony, and the patient was extubated. CONCLUSIONS This report shows the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the management of delivery of infants with airway obstruction. This case demonstrates the approach to the decision for the use of EXIT combined with airway palliation, as ECMO was not combined with EXIT in this case. TEXT: Background Morbidity and mortality are significantly elevated in deliveries of neonates with undiagnosed fetal neck masses [1]. Failure to secure the airway in a timely fashion, if at all, in such difficult circumstances leads to extremely poor outcomes for the neonates. The management of delivery of infants with airway obstruction differs in many ways from that of adults and has been detailed by Harless et al. [2]. While ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow for superbly detailed examination of these masses, clinically executing the delivery of these neonates remains very challenging and requires extensive collaboration among many teams. The Ex Utero Intrapartum Treatment (EXIT) procedure, the successor to the Operation on Placental Support (OOPS) intervention, is a procedure aimed at delivering infants safely that have severely debilitating congenital disorders or other disease processes which otherwise may be fatal. As described in the name of the procedure, the goal is to provide reliable airway treatment externally through the uterus to the fetus prior to delivery [3,4].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Extubation, Uterine atony, Uterine hypotonus, Uterine hypokinesia, Inhalation therapy, Bimanual uterine compression, Uterine spasm, Uterine peristalsis absent, Arrested labour, Respiratory therapy, Chest tube removal, Tracheostomy tube removal, Respiratory disorder prophylaxis, Uterine hypertonus, Vaginal relaxation, Drain removal, Incoordinate uterine action, Uterine obstruction, Cast removal, Airway secretion clearance therapy, Catheter removal, Cervix dystocia, Uterine contractions during pregnancy, Nephrostomy tube removal, Postpartum uterine subinvolution, Uterine contractions abnormal, Drug ineffective, Endometrium arrested stage, Medical device removal, Uterine hyperstimulation, Ear tube removal, Gastrointestinal tube removal, Positive expiratory pressure therapy, Continuous positive airway pressure, Antitussive therapy, Rhinitis prophylaxis, Uterine irritability, Uterine tachysystole, Uterine stenosis, Uterine inversion, Airway remodelling, Oxygen therapy, Positive end-expiratory pressure, Asthma prophylaxis, Shortened cervix, Cough, Elective surgery, Tracheobronchial stent removal, Bladder catheter removal, Cervical dilatation\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653957.7930806}
