ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon and life-threating condition characterized by major immune activation and massive cytokine production by mononuclear inflammatory cells, due to defects in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. It is even more unusual in renal transplant recipients, in which it is often associated with uncontrolled infection. The mortality is high in HLH and differential diagnosis with sepsis is a challenge. The approach and management depend on the underlying trigger and comorbidities. We report a case of a 50-year-old renal transplant female admitted with fever and malaise 3 months post-transplant and presenting anemia, fever, hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of serum ferritin, and positive CMV antigenemia. Urine was positive for decoy cells and BKV-DNA. Graft biopsy showed CMV nephritis. Both blood and urine cultures where positive for E. coli. Hemophagocytosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone, with complete response after 3 weeks. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of a rare and serious condition in a renal transplant patient, which can allow a favorable clinical course and improve survival rate. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) consists of an immune hyperactivation syndrome that takes place when NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to eliminate activated macrophages, leading to over production of proinflammatory cytokines1. There are primary and acquired causes. Primary HLH is rare and typically manifests in childhood because of two autosomal recessive defects in genes that encode proteins involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules during apoptosis in natural killer (NK) cells.1 , 2Acquired (secondary) HLH is triggered by various conditions as infections, immunodeficiency, rheumatologic diseases, and cancer.1 , 3 , 4 Infection is the most common precipitating factor of HLH in adults, mainly viruses of herpes family (EBV, CMV, HSV, HHV8), but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens can also be a trigger.5 , 6 Multiorgan involvement and organomegaly are frequently found and hemophagocytosis results in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of HLH is based on the presence of at least 5 of the following 8 criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting \\\\u2265 2 lineages of peripheral blood cells), hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, serum ferritin >500 ng/mL, low activity of NK cells, soluble CD25 > 2.400 U/mL and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes.7 Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red cells, platelets, or white cells in macrophage cytoplasm visualized in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.2 The syndrome is defined by a complex picture. However, some patients may have incipient or partial disease.1 Most diagnostic\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Neutropenia, Pancytopenia, Infection, Thrombocytopenia, Cytomegalovirus infection, Febrile neutropenia, Bone marrow failure, Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Leukopenia, Hypertriglyceridaemia, Anaemia, Cytopenia, Fungal infection, Hyperglycaemia, Apoptosis, Bacterial infection, Herpes simplex, Agranulocytosis, Sepsis, Hyperlipidaemia, Granulocytopenia, Hypercholesterolaemia, Condition aggravated, Blood triglycerides increased, Platelet count decreased, Hyper HDL cholesterolaemia, Aplastic anaemia, Herpes virus infection, Pyrexia, Cell death, Herpes simplex hepatitis, Cytomegalovirus viraemia, Familial hypertriglyceridaemia, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Cytomegalovirus infection reactivation, Immune-mediated pancytopenia, Disease progression, Familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Type III hyperlipidaemia, Acquired mixed hyperlipidaemia, Varicella, Type I hyperlipidaemia, Autoimmune pancytopenia, Type II hyperlipidaemia, Infection parasitic, Type V hyperlipidaemia, Blood cholesterol increased, Lipids increased, Type IV hyperlipidaemia, Plasmablast count decreased\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: We report a case of rhabdomyolysis and severe acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring dialysis in a 69-year-old male who was recently started on sitagliptin while on chronic simvastatin therapy. This potential interaction is not included in the package insert for sitagliptin. A comprehensive literature review revealed six previous reports of rhabdomyolysis due to drug interaction between sitagliptin and statins including simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin. Of these six cases, only two had developed rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI, none of which were severe enough to require dialysis. As patients are commonly prescribed statins and sitagliptin for treatment of dyslipidemia and diabetes, health care professionals should be aware of this potential drug interaction and closely monitor their patients for signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis and AKI. This case highlights the importance of conducting further studies on the risk of muscular toxicity of sitagliptin especially when administered concurrently with statins. TEXT: 1. Introduction Sitagliptin belongs to a class of oral antihyperglycemic drugs known as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors [1]. Statin use for management of dyslipidemia is common in patients with diabetes. We present a patient on long-term simvastatin therapy who developed severe rhabdomyolysis and AKI soon after starting treatment with sitagliptin. 2. Case Presentation A 69-year-old white male with history of hypertension, noninsulin-dependent diabetes, chronic kidney disease stage 3, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure was brought to hospital with complaints of generalized malaise, muscle weakness with pain in both his lower extremities, and inability to ambulate for last 4-5 days. He had developed these symptoms within 2 days of starting sitagliptin (Januvia 100 mg) therapy. His other medications included simvastatin, amlodipine, carvedilol, clopidogrel, gabapentin, glipizide, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, quinapril, and ezetimibe. He gave history of similar weakness when he was started on sitagliptin therapy few months ago, so he discontinued it by himself. His primary care physician however restarted it again at recent follow-up, when the patient refused insulin therapy.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Pain, Rhabdomyolysis, Muscular weakness, Fatigue, Cardiac failure, Malaise, Headache, Cardiac failure congestive, Diabetes mellitus, Coronary artery disease, Asthenia, Condition aggravated, Abdominal pain, Hyperlipidaemia, Dyslipidaemia, Hypertriglyceridaemia, Hypercholesterolaemia, General physical health deterioration, Congestive cardiomyopathy, Arteriosclerosis coronary artery, Hypo HDL cholesterolaemia, Nausea, Tenderness, Cardiac failure acute, Diabetic ketoacidosis, Cardiac failure high output, Hyperglycaemia, Hypolipidaemia, Gait disturbance, Hyper HDL cholesterolaemia, Cardiac failure chronic, Diabetic dyslipidaemia, Myocardial ischaemia, Lipids decreased, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Dyspnoea, Acute kidney injury, Lipoprotein deficiency, Arthralgia, Acquired mixed hyperlipidaemia, Lipids increased, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Blood cholesterol increased, Ventricular failure, High density lipoprotein decreased, Right ventricular failure, Hypotriglyceridaemia, Angina pectoris, Acute coronary syndrome, Remnant hyperlipidaemia\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653650.994746}
