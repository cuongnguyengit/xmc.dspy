ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: The efficacy of the submucosal injection of lidocaine during endoscopic submucosal dissection for colorectal neoplasms: a multicenter randomized controlled study. ABSTRACT: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is currently a common procedure although it requires a long procedural time. We conducted a prospective study to determine the efficacy and safety of lidocaine injection for shortening the procedural time and relieving bowel peristalsis during ESD. A multicenter randomized controlled study was conducted in three hospitals. Ninety-one patients who underwent colorectal ESD were enrolled. Patients were randomly divided into two groups using the envelope method: the lidocaine group and saline group. The primary endpoint was the procedural time, and the secondary endpoints were the procedural time in each part of the colon and the grade of bowel peristalsis and the incidence and amounts of antispasmodic drugs use and adverse events. The patients\\' demographics were not markedly different between the two groups. The mean procedural time in the lidocaine group was not markedly different from that in the saline group. In contrast, at the proximal site, the procedural time in the lidocaine group (57 min) was significantly shorter in the saline group (80 min). The grade of bowel peristalsis in the lidocaine group (0.67) was significantly lower than in the saline group (1.17). Antispasmodic drug use was significantly rarer in the lidocaine group than in the saline group. The incidence of adverse events was not markedly different between the two groups. Local lidocaine injection is a feasible option for preventing bowel peristalsis, particularly in the proximal colon, leading to a reduced procedural time for ESD and decreased antispasmodic drug use.

TEXT: Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a common procedure for the treatment of colorectal T1 cancer, particularly large lesions. However, ESD carries a high risk of perforation and requires a longer procedural time than other endoscopic procedures, including polypectomy and endoscopic mucosal resection [1]. Submucosal fibrosis, difficulties maintaining scope positioning, and bowel peristalsis are thought to underlie the long procedural time [2\\\\u20134].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Perforation, Diarrhoea, Constipation, Gastrointestinal motility disorder, Bowel movement irregularity, Gastrointestinal hypermotility, Urine sodium, Blood sodium, Ileus, Volvulus of small bowel, Gastrointestinal hypomotility, Ileus paralytic, Vomiting, Nausea, Ileus spastic, Haemorrhage, Dehydration, Blood chloride, Perforated ulcer, Intestinal strangulation, Sinus perforation, Faecal disimpaction, Pneumatosis intestinalis, Intestinal obstruction, Dyschezia, Peristalsis visible, Obstructive defaecation, Volvulus, Intestinal transit time increased, Urine sodium increased, Fluid replacement, Anal sphincter hypertonia, Frequent bowel movements, Blood sodium decreased, Surgery, Intestinal prolapse, Irritable bowel syndrome, Intussusception, Neurogenic bowel, Intestinal perforation, Gastrointestinal perforation, Intestinal transit time decreased, Change of bowel habit, Electrolyte substitution therapy, Intestinal atony, Small intestinal intussusception reduction, Intestinal pseudo-obstruction, Hernia perforation, Enteroclysis, Defaecation urgency\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653953.372478}
