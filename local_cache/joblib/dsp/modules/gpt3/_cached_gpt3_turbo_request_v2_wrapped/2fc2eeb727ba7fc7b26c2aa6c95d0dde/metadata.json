ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Bone is a frequent site of metastases in advanced cancers including lung, breast, prostate, kidney, or myeloma. Lesions are commonly located on the spine. Neoplastic invasion of the vertebral body can result in painful vertebral fractures, leading to disability and substantial morbidity. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to treat spinal fractures due to osteolytic tumors. It could result in pain reduction or resolution in 80-90% of patients with fractures, and it improves stability. Although considered safe, vertebroplasty has been associated over the years with life-threatening complications. We have reported the case of a 55-year-old patient with lung adenocarcinoma, who underwent vertebroplasty for a pathological neoplastic fracture of L2. The procedure was complicated by a leak of cement into the systemic venous circulation, characterized by an 11-cm filament in the right heart chambers and multiple pulmonary emboli. To our knowledge, only one similar case was previously reported, involving an intracardiac cement filament longer than 10 cm. The data are scant, hence the importance of collecting and reporting possible complications about what is perceived as a rather safe procedure. The case highlights the need for a robust postprocedure imaging plan to detect complications, which can impact patients\\' morbidity and survival. TEXT: Introduction Bone is a frequent site of metastases in advanced cancers including lung, breast, prostate, kidney or myeloma. Lesions are commonly located on the spine. Neoplastic invasion of the vertebral body can result in painful vertebral fractures, leading to disability and substantial morbidity [1]. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to treat vertebral hemangiomas and spinal fractures due to osteoporosis or osteolytic tumors of the spine. This method leads to pain reduction or resolution in 80\\\\u201390% of patients with fractures [2], and it improves stability. Generally considered safe [3], vertebroplasty has been associated over the years with life-threatening complications (i.e., compressive myelopathy and radiculopathy due to cement leakage) [4].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Neuropathy peripheral, Radiculopathy, Vertebroplasty, Spinal cord compression, Sacral radiculopathy, Spinal deformity correction, Lumbosacral radiculopathy, Cervical radiculopathy, Dental leakage, Traumatic spinal cord compression, Spinal fusion surgery, Device leakage, Thoracic radiculopathy, Lumbar radiculopathy, Radiculitis brachial, Vertebral body replacement, Scoliosis surgery, Peripheral nerve lesion, Nerve root injury, Cauda equina syndrome, Myelopathy, Spinal operation, Open reduction of spinal fracture, Lumbosacral plexopathy, Spinal cord disorder, Radicular pain, Implant site extravasation, Chondroplasty, Polyneuropathy, Radiation myelopathy, Systemic leakage, Internal fixation of spine, Spinal cord injury, Lumbosacral plexus lesion, Peripheral sensory neuropathy, Neuritis, Peripheral motor neuropathy, Nerve root injury sacral, Medical device site extravasation, Laminaplasty, Product leakage, Spinal cord ischaemia, Conus medullaris syndrome, Spinal fracture treatment, Implant site discharge, Neuralgia, Morton\\'s neuralgia, Cerebrospinal fluid leakage, Nerve compression, Joint arthroplasty\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
