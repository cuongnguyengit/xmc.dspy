ABSTRACT: Conventional skeletal chondrosarcoma is a bone neoplasm, which is poorly sensitive to anthracyclines-based chemotherapy. We report on an 18-month-long tumour response to gemcitabine as single agent in a young patient with an advanced secondary peripheral conventional chondrosarcoma, previously treated unsuccessfully with anthracyclines, ifosfamide, platinum, etoposide. TEXT: Background The skeletal chondrosarcoma family represents a heterogeneous group of malignant bone mesenchymal tumours characterised by the production of a chondroid matrix. They are the third bone sarcoma in incidence, and the most frequent in adults. There are three main subtypes: conventional, mesenchymal, and clear-cell. A \\\\u201cdedifferentiated\\\\u201d chondrosarcoma develops in 10-15% of conventional chondrosarcomas, while mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a high-grade, aggressive neoplasm with a natural history and chemosensitivity that might be close to Ewing sarcoma, and clear-cell chondrosarcoma is a low-grade variant [1]. In conventional chondrosarcoma (cCS), the histological malignancy grade is the main prognostic factor [2]. Grade 1 cCS are characterised by a very low metastatic potential, and some authors have quite recently suggested a re-classification of these types as \\\\u201catypical cartilaginous tumours\\\\u201d [1]. Grade 2 and 3 cCS are marked by a higher metastatic potential, with a 10-year survival of 64-86% and 29-55% respectively [3,4]. CCSs are also categorised according to their location in the bone: a central chondrosarcoma onsets in the medullary cavity, a small percentage of them from a pre-existing benign lesion known as enchondroma, while a peripheral variant arises from the surface of the bone, as a result of malignant progression of a pre-existing benign (solitary or hereditary) osteochondroma. Surgery is the mainstay of the treatment of localized disease. While curettage is acceptable for grade 1 cCS, wide excision is usually required for higher grade cCS, with the exception of skull base cCS which may be treated with radiotherapy. In particular, hadrons can play an important role in the management of skull base cCS, and very good outcomes are reported [5].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Blood cadmium, Drug resistance, Alpha interferon therapy, Interferon therapy, Gamma interferon therapy, Blood lead, Drug ineffective, Antibiotic therapy, Metal poisoning, Beta interferon therapy, Cytarabine syndrome, Urine beryllium, Immunosuppression, Chemotherapy, Lead urine, Periprosthetic metallosis, Blood cadmium increased, Blood beryllium, Eosinophilic oesophagitis, Thrombocytopenia, Manganese, Blood chromium, Eosinophilia, Blood cadmium decreased, Blood copper, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Blood aluminium, Streptococcal infection, Condition aggravated, Antiviral treatment, Chemotherapy multiple agents systemic, Gadolinium deposition disease, Anthrax, Pneumonia anthrax, Exposure to lead, Eosinophil cationic protein, Blood lead increased, Blood cadmium normal, Argyria, Urine copper, Immunosuppressant drug level, Blood heavy metal test, Interleukin therapy, Bone marrow eosinophilic leukocyte count increased, Cutaneous anthrax, Urine chromium, Lead urine increased, Adenocarcinoma metastatic, Chemotherapy single agent systemic, Metal fume fever\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653547.6221983}
