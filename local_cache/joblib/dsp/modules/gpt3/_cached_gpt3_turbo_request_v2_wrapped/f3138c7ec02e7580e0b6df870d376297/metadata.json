ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Diagnostic pitfalls: intramyocardial lymphoma metastasis mimics acute coronary syndrome in a diffuse large B cell lymphoma patient-case report. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Cardiac tumors are very uncommon compared to other cardiac diseases. Their clinical symptoms can vary from absent to non-specific. The most common symptoms are arrhythmias, blood flow obstruction due to valvular dysfunction, shortness of breath, systemic embolization, and accumulation of pericardial fluid. Hereby, we describe a very rare case of a diffuse large B cell lymphoma patient who presented with the symptoms and signs of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) but the patient\\'s complaints were caused by his intramyocardial lymphoma metastasis. METHODS Forty-eight-year-old diffuse large B cell lymphoma patient was admitted to our emergency department with chest pain, effort dyspnea, and fever. The patient had normal blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation, sinus tachycardia, fever, crackles over the left lower lobe, novum incomplete right bundle branch block with Q waves and minor ST alterations, elevated C-reactive protein, high-sensitivity troponin-T, and d-dimer levels. Chest X-ray revealed consolidation on the left side and enlarged heart. Bed side transthoracic echocardiography showed inferior akinesis with pericardial fluid. Coronary angiography showed no occlusion or significant stenosis. Chest computed tomography demonstrated the progression of his lymphoma in the myocardium. He was admitted to the Department of Hematology for immediate chemotherapy and he reached complete metabolic remission, followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Unfortunately, about 9 months later, he developed bone marrow deficiency consequently severe sepsis, septic shock, and multiple organ failure what he did not survive. CONCLUSIONS Our case demonstrates a very rare manifestation of a heart metastasis. ACS is an unusual symptom of cardiac tumors. But our patient\\'s intramyocardial lymphoma in the right atrium and ventricle externally compressed the right coronary artery and damaged the heart tissue, causing the patient\\'s symptoms which imitated ACS. Fortunately, the quick diagnostics and immediate aggressive chemotherapy provided the patient\\'s remission and suitability to further treatment.
