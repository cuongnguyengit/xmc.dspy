ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Liver Injury Associated With Ezetimibe Monotherapy. ABSTRACT: Statin intolerance, primarily myalgia, is not uncommon in patients treated for elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Nonstatin drugs, such as ezetimibe, can spare patients from statin exposure, while still reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Ezetimibe is generally very well tolerated, although gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms have been occasionally reported. We describe an extremely rare case of an ezetimibe-associated liver injury who required protracted treatment with prednisone and azathioprine. Ezetimibe-associated liver injury should be suspected with development of hepatic abnormalities concurrent with the timing of ezetimibe treatment and in the absence of other possible precipitating factors. TEXT: Statins are the cornerstone therapy to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and its associated risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.1 However, statin intolerance, primarily statin-associated muscle symptoms affect 2.5%-5% of patients.2 Nonstatin drugs are thus essential to spare affected patients from statin exposure, while still reducing LDL cholesterol.1 Treatment guidelines endorse the use of both ezetimibe and inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) as safe and effective second-line LDL-lowering treatments to consider in response to statin intolerance.1 Ezetimibe lowers LDL cholesterol by blocking sterol uptake via the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein (NPC1L1) in the upper small intestine.3 It has been available in Canada since 2003. Ezetimibe is generally very well tolerated, although gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms have been reported in approximately 0.1%-2% of patients.4, 5, 6, 7 Although no cases of ezetimibe-induced liver injury were observed in randomized clinical trials, there are a few case reports of this complication.4, 5, 6, 7 We describe an extremely rare case of an ezetimibe-associated liver injury. Case Report A 59-year-old asymptomatic man of European descent was referred to the lipid clinic with high LDL cholesterol levels. His medical history was positive only for appendectomy and he was not taking any medication including neither natural health products nor supplements. He had no history of the use of either alcohol or recreational drugs. His family history was positive for dyslipidemia in 2 brothers, one of whom died of a myocardial infarction at age 67. The patient\\\\u2019s father and mother each also died from sudden cardiac events at ages 62 and 80, respectively. On physical examination, his height was 180 cm, weight was 81.5 kg, body mass index (BMI) was 25.2 kg/m2, supine blood pressure was 104/60 mm Hg, and radial pulse was 75 beats/min. No physical stigmata of familial hypercholesterolemia were detected, that is, no xanthomas, xanthelasmas, or corneal arcus. There was no hepatosplenomegaly, and cardiovascular examination was normal.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Diarrhoea, Nausea, Drug ineffective, Vomiting, Liver injury, Myocardial infarction, Drug-induced liver injury, Acute myocardial infarction, Cardiac arrest, Hepatocellular injury, Hepatosplenomegaly, Dyslipidaemia, Myalgia, Hepatotoxicity, Abdominal pain, Xanthoma, Hepatomegaly, Traumatic liver injury, Drug resistance, Constipation, Xanthelasma, Primary hypercholesterolaemia, Xanthomatosis, Fatigue, Hypo HDL cholesterolaemia, Acute cardiac event, Splenomegaly, Cardiovascular disorder, Hypolipidaemia, Familial hypertriglyceridaemia, Gastrointestinal disorder, Drug intolerance, Asthenia, Type II hyperlipidaemia, Diabetic dyslipidaemia, Type I hyperlipidaemia, Type V hyperlipidaemia, Type IIb hyperlipidaemia, Lipids decreased, Type IIa hyperlipidaemia, Type III hyperlipidaemia, Lipoprotein deficiency, Type IV hyperlipidaemia, Hepatic failure, Abdominal discomfort, Sudden cardiac death, Muscular weakness, Mixed liver injury, Familial high density lipoprotein deficiency, High density lipoprotein decreased\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706654003.889826}
