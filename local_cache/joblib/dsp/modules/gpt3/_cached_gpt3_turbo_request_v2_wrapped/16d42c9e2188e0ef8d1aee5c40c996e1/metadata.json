ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: The use of esketamine in comorbid treatment resistant depression and obsessive compulsive disorder following extensive pharmacogenomic testing: a case report. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Major depressive disorder (MDD) patients not responding to two or more different antidepressant treatments are currently considered to suffer from treatment resistant depression (TRD). Recently, intranasal esketamine has been approved by both the American Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency for TRD and, more recently, in moderate to severe episode of MDD, as acute short-term treatment for the rapid reduction of depressive symptoms, which, according to clinical judgement, constitute a psychiatric emergency. There is currently no indication for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) although recently published studies have already shown a rapid and significant reduction of OCD-like symptoms following ketamine administration. The etiology of OCD has not yet been fully elucidated but there is a growing evidence that glutamate signaling dysfunction in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuitry plays an essential role. This case report exemplifies possible clinical effects of esketamine on both depressive and OCD symptoms. METHODS We present the case of a 39-year-old man suffering from TRD. During the first evaluation at our clinic, he also reported the presence of OCD spectrum symptoms, causing him to perform time-consuming mental rituals due to pathological doubts regarding the relationship with his wife as well as intrusive thoughts regarding his mental conditions. He underwent psychometric evaluations, therapeutic drug monitoring analysis, and pharmacogenomic tests. The overall results helped to explain patient\\'s treatment-resistance. Moreover, we observed a significant reduction in both depressive and OCD symptoms after administration of esketamine. CONCLUSIONS This case underlines the importance of pharmacogenomic tests in profiling TRD patients and confirms the possible use of esketamine in the treatment of comorbid OCD.

We need to identify the adverse reactions that are directly expressed in the article snippet. The article discusses a case report of a patient with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms. The patient was treated with esketamine, and the article mentions a significant reduction in both depressive and OCD symptoms. There is no mention of adverse reactions to the treatment in the provided snippet. Instead, the article focuses on the efficacy of esketamine in reducing symptoms of TRD and OCD. Therefore, we cannot select any adverse reactions from the options provided, as none are mentioned in the article snippet.\\\\n\\\\nReactions:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653918.4286726}
