ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) involvement in the central nervous system (CNS) is particularly rare. SPTCL with CNS involvement has an exceedingly poor prognosis, and no optimum therapeutic method has been discovered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of SPTCL invading the CNS achieving long-term remission with lenalidomide maintenance therapy. METHODS A 63-year-old man diagnosed with SPTCL was admitted to the hospital with severe headache for 15 d after four cycles of chemotherapy. Subsequent to the treatment, the patient developed CNS involvement. Craniotomy biopsy was pathologically diagnosed as CNS T-cell lymphoma, and two courses of chemotherapy were performed postoperatively. Due to the intolerance of the side effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, the patient received lenalidomide instead. The magnetic resonance imaging of the head at the 8 mo follow-up indicated no signs of recurrence, and the vital signs were stable. CONCLUSIONS Lenalidomide deserves further investigation as a targeted drug for SPTCL cases involving the CNS. TEXT: Core Tip: Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma is a rare peripheral T-cell lymphoma that occurs primarily in the skin. We present a special case of central nervous system T-cell lymphoma secondary to subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. Lenalidomide deserves further investigation as a targeted drug for subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma cases involving the central nervous system. INTRODUCTION According to the World Health Organization-European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer in 2008, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL) is a rare peripheral skin T-cell lymphoma, which accounts for less than 1% of all non-Hodgkin\\\\u2019s lymphomas and primary skin T-cell lymphomas. It primarily involves subcutaneous adipose tissue typically derived from \\\\u03b1/\\\\u03b2 T-cells with a favorable prognosis in the absence of hemophagocytic syndrome[1,2]. SPTCL is most commonly seen in young adult females, with a male-female ratio of 0.5[1]. Patients with SPTCL typically present with multiple subcutaneous tender nodules, which are principally found in the limbs and torso and often resembles other diseases such as lupus panniculitis[3]. The involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) in non-Hodgkin\\\\u2019s lymphoma is a fatal complication with a survival probability of less than 5%[4]. CNS involvement in SPTCL is fatal, and there is no consensus on the best treatment. In this paper, we describe a case of CNS T-cell lymphoma secondary to SPTCL in a 63-year-old man and summarize a literature review.

The article does not provide specific details about the side effects experienced by the patient, but it does imply that there were adverse reactions to chemotherapy that led to the switch in treatment.
