ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: An elderly Japanese woman developed acute decompensated heart failure caused by persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Approximately 6 days after starting intravenous administration of amiodarone (600 mg/day) for maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of AF, electrocardiograms revealed a prolonged QT interval associated with torsade de pointes (TdP). The amiodarone-induced TdP disappeared after intravenous administration of landiolol plus magnesium and potassium, without discontinuation of amiodarone or overdrive cardiac pacing, although the prolonged QT interval persisted. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that landiolol could be effective for amiodarone-induced TdP. TEXT: pmc1 INTRODUCTION Torsade de pointes (TdP) is a potentially lethal form of ventricular tachycardia (Drew et al., 2010). An increased risk of TdP is associated with a prolonged heart rate\\\\u2010corrected QT interval on electrocardiogram (ECG), which represents a pathophysiological substrate for long QT syndrome (LQTS) classified into genetic and acquired forms. Therapeutic drugs are a major cause of acquired LQTS, including class IA and III antiarrhythmic agents and many non\\\\u2010antiarrhythmic agents. Treatment of drug\\\\u2010induced TdP should involve (a) discontinuation of the culprit drug, (b) intravenous administration of magnesium and potassium, and (c) intravenous administration of isoproterenol or temporary cardiac pacing. This report describes a case of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) caused by atrial fibrillation (AF)\\\\u2010mediated cardiomyopathy (Qin et al., 2019) and subsequently complicated with TdP induced by amiodarone intravenously administered to prevent AF. Although the prolonged QT interval persisted, the amiodarone\\\\u2010induced TdP disappeared after intravenous administration of landiolol hydrochloride, an ultra\\\\u2010short\\\\u2010acting \\\\u03b21\\\\u2010superselective \\\\u03b2\\\\u2010adrenergic blocker (Ikeda et al., 2019), plus magnesium and potassium, without discontinuation of amiodarone hydrochloride or overdrive cardiac pacing. 2 CASE PRESENTATION An 83\\\\u2010year\\\\u2010old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital with a 3\\\\u2010day history of exertional dyspnea and anorexia. She had no history of smoking or consuming alcohol. Her medical history included long\\\\u2010standing hypertension and dyslipidemia, and she had been prescribed valsartan (40 mg/day), amlodipine besylate (10 mg/day), trichlormethiazide (1 mg/day), and atorvastatin calcium hydrate (5 mg/day) at another clinic.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Electrocardiogram QT prolonged, Torsade de pointes, Ventricular tachycardia, Electrocardiogram QRS complex prolonged, Cardiac arrest, Ventricular fibrillation, Electrocardiogram QT interval abnormal, Blood potassium, Long QT syndrome, Urine potassium, Electrocardiogram QT interval, Blood magnesium, Death, Hypokalaemia, Ventricular tachyarrhythmia, Hyperkalaemia, Ventricular flutter, Electrocardiogram RR interval prolonged, Tachycardia, Electrocardiogram QT shortened, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Urine magnesium, Blood potassium decreased, Ventricular arrhythmia, Long QT syndrome congenital, Electrocardiogram QRS complex, Electrocardiogram QRS complex abnormal, Blood potassium increased, Cardiac flutter, Urine potassium increased, Sudden cardiac death, Electrocardiogram PR prolongation, Tidal volume, Manganese, Electrocardiogram QRS complex shortened, Urine potassium decreased, Magnesium deficiency, Electrocardiogram repolarisation abnormality, Electrocardiogram Q waves, Urine potassium abnormal, Respiratory failure, Blood potassium abnormal, Blood potassium normal, Electrocardiogram QT interval normal, Urine potassium normal, Cardiac fibrillation, Blood aluminium, Blood magnesium decreased, Adams-Stokes syndrome, Ventricular extrasystoles\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
