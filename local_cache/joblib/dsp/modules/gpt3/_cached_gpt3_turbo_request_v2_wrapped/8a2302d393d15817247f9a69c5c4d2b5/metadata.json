ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Treatment with Ramucirumab-paclitaxel in a metastatic gastric cancer patient undergoing hemodialysis: A case report. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Ramucirumab, a human Ig 1 monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2, in combination with paclitaxel is a second-line chemotherapy for patients with metastatic gastric cancer. Several reports have suggested that dose adjustments of cetuximab, an anti- epidermal growth factor receptor antibody, are not required in patients with renal impairment. However, the combination chemotherapy of ramucirumab and cytotoxic drug for hemodialysis (HD) patients has not been reported. A 65-year-old man on HD was diagnosed with gastric cancer and underwent a subtotal gastrectomy with D2 lymphadenectomy. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was examined after completion of 8 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine combination oxaliplatin. METHODS The patient was diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer at stage IIIb (pT3N2M0) 11 months ago. Unfortunately, 9 months after the start of adjuvant chemotherapy, multiple liver metastases from gastric cancer were found by abdominal CT. METHODS He began receiving weekly paclitaxel(80 mg/m2) and every 15-day ramucirumab (8 mg/kg). HD was performed next day after administration of chemotherapy and repeated 3 times a week. RESULTS He was treated with ramucirumab without dose adjustment. The metastatic liver mass had a partial response, after 2 and 4 cycles of chemotherapy and had a stable disease up to 12 cycles of chemotherapy. No obvious adverse effect was observed during treatment. However, after 14 cycles chemotherapy, follow-up abdominal CT revealed progression disease of multiple liver metastasis and lymph nodes invasion. CONCLUSIONS The paclitaxel chemotherapy with ramucirumab is effective and safe in HD patients with metastatic gastric cancer. As seen in patients with normal kidney function, ramucirumab can be safely administered without a dose reduction. TEXT: pmc1 Introduction Gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer-related death and high mortality.[1,2] Currently, chemotherapy based on a combination of fluoropyrimidines and platinum compounds is the standard treatment in first-line therapy.[3] Based on the result of a randomized phase III trials, ramucirumab monotherapy or in combination with paclitaxel was proven safe and effective for patients with metastatic gastric cancer progressed after a first-line of chemotherapy.[4,5] Ramucirumab is a human IgG 1 monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 that prevents ligand binding and receptor-mediated pathway activation in endothelial cells, resulting in the inhibition of angiogenesis.[6]. However, there is no data on ramucirumab therapy in patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis (HD). We herein report the first case of a metastatic gastric cancer patient on HD who was successfully treated with ramucirumab combination paclitaxel. 2 Case presentation\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Gastric cancer, Metastatic gastric cancer, Metastases to stomach, Gastric cancer stage IV, Adenocarcinoma gastric, Gastrinoma malignant, HER2 positive gastric cancer, Gastric neoplasm, Venous arterialisation, Gastric cancer recurrent, Gastric sarcoma, Gastrooesophageal cancer, Gastrointestinal cancer metastatic, Gastric cancer stage 0, Neovascularisation, Metastases to gastrointestinal tract, Angiodysplasia, Gastric cancer stage II, Angiopathy, Carcinoid tumour of the stomach, Gastric cancer stage III, Vascular wall hypertrophy, Gastric cancer stage I, Malignant neoplasm progression, Gastrointestinal carcinoma, Vomiting, Metastases to oesophagus, Angiogenesis biomarker, Retinal neovascularisation, Metastases to liver, Stomach mass, Oesophageal cancer metastatic, Nausea, Angiogenesis biomarker increased, Vascular endothelial growth factor overexpression, Gastric disorder, Positive vessel remodelling, Metastases to abdominal cavity, Gastric adenoma, Benign gastric neoplasm, Gastric dysplasia, Metastases to abdominal wall, Germ cell cancer metastatic, Linitis plastica, Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia, Metastases to central nervous system, Anti-insulin receptor antibody, Gastric polyps, Gastric ulcer, Telangiectasia\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output. The second article snippet is about a case report of a patient with metastatic gastric cancer undergoing hemodialysis who was treated with ramucirumab-paclitaxel. The article does not list adverse reactions to the treatment but rather focuses on the effectiveness and safety of the treatment in a patient with renal impairment. The article mentions that no obvious adverse effect was observed during treatment, and it concludes that the treatment is effective and safe for hemodialysis patients. Therefore, none of the listed adverse reactions are directly expressed in the snippet provided.\\\\n\\\\nReactions:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653927.2798784}
