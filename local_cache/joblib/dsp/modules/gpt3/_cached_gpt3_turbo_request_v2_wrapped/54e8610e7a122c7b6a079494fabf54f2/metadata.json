ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is generally treated with multiple PAH-specific vasodilators. If these agents are unsuccessful, additional treatment options are scarce, and the prognosis is poor due to right-sided heart failure. Some of these severe cases are also accompanied by endocrinological side effects. The most common side effect of prostacyclin is thyroid dysfunction, but in very few cases, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency may occur. A 35-year-old woman was diagnosed with hereditary PAH 2 years ago. Since her mean pulmonary arterial pressure was high, combination therapy of vasodilators, including prostacyclin, was introduced. Several months later, she was hospitalized with a persistent fever. Laboratory tests showed no findings suggestive of infection. However, hypereosinophilia and decreased secretion of ACTH and cortisol were noted, which led to the diagnosis of ACTH deficiency. A multimodal diagnostic approach, including pituitary magnetic resonance imaging and axillary lymph node biopsy, indicated that the aetiology of the ACTH deficiency was likely autoimmune hypophysitis. She was treated with hydrocortisone supplementation, which significantly relieved her condition. Endocrinological side effects in PAH patients using prostacyclin should be carefully addressed. If right-sided heart failure worsens during the administration of prostacyclin, it is essential to determine whether it is due to progression of pulmonary hypertension or endocrinological side effects. Careful diagnosis and treatment are important for managing the haemodynamics and symptoms of PAH patients given prostacyclin. TEXT: Learning points Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency is a potential but rare side effect of prostacyclin therapy in pulmonary arterial hypertension patients. Diagnosis of ACTH deficiency is based on endocrinological findings, although fever and hypereosinophilia may be initial clues. In this case, the administration of hydrocortisone not only alleviated the symptoms of ACTH deficiency but also reduced the severity of right-sided heart overload. Introduction Prostacyclin analogues, such as epoprostenol and treprostinil, are important treatment options for managing patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).1 However, this drug has many side effects, including headache, temporomandibular joint pain, facial flushing, diarrhoea, and thrombocytopenia. In addition, endocrine abnormalities, such as thyroid dysfunction, are known to occur.2 A few cases of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency have also been reported.3,4 However, its causal relationship or pathological mechanisms remain to be established.

Combination therapy including subcutaneous infusion of treprostinil was introduced.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Diarrhoea, Thrombocytopenia, Headache, Constipation, Eosinophilia, Platelet count decreased, Pain, Nausea, Arthralgia, Flushing, Vomiting, Hypereosinophilic syndrome, Pancytopenia, Adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency, Hypothyroidism, Rash, Thyroid disorder, Hyperthyroidism, Leukopenia, Pain in jaw, Immune thrombocytopenia, Thrombocytopenic purpura, Tension headache, Eosinophil count increased, Adrenal insufficiency, Leukocytosis, Neutropenia, Thrombocytosis, Temporomandibular joint syndrome, Diarrhoea infectious, Vascular headache, Abdominal pain, Erythema, Goitre, Pulmonary eosinophilia, Allergic eosinophilia, Eosinophil percentage increased, Diarrhoea haemorrhagic, Post procedural diarrhoea, Defaecation disorder, Bacterial diarrhoea, Frequent bowel movements, Eosinophil morphology abnormal, Thyroid function test abnormal, Defaecation urgency, Cluster headache, Gastrointestinal disorder, Hypotension, Cortisol decreased, Sinus headache\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653919.537931}
