ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: New drugs come not only with benefits but also with unexpected toxicities which need to be promptly recognized and managed. Starting from a scholar case of acute heart failure with preserved ejection fraction following the administration of trabectedin (ET-743, Yondelis\\\\u00ae) in a patient with a metastatic solitary fibrous tumor, we performed a systematic review of the literature encompassing the results of previous cardiac safety analysis published ten years ago, a review of clinical trials published during the last 10 years as well as single-case descriptions related to trabectedin cardiotoxicity. The estimated incidence of cardiac toxicity was 3,4% among patients receiving trabectedin, with recent data suggesting a higher rate of heart failure than previously recognized. Previous or concomitant anthracyclines exposure may represent a risk factor. Assaying for NT-pro-BNP may be useful for the early detection of individuals with trabectedin-induced heart failure. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Trabectedin (code ATC L01CX01, also known as ecteinascidin 743 or ET-743 \\\\u2013 Yondelis \\\\u00ae) is a synthetically produced tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloid originally derived from the Caribbean marine tunicate, Ecteinascidia turbinata (1). Trabectedin (Tbt) has a direct effect against tumor cells but has also host-modulating properties (2\\\\u20134). The drug interacts with the DNA minor groove and alkylates guanine at the N2 position, which bends towards the major groove. It is thought that the molecule affects several transcription factors involved in cell proliferation, particularly through the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair system (3). Tbt blocks the cell cycle at the G(2) phase, cells in the G(1) phase being most sensitive to the drug. It also inhibits overexpression of the multidrug resistance-1 gene (MDR-1) coding for the P-glycoprotein (1). Tbt is approved for the treatment of advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS) after failure of treatments with anthracyclines and ifosfamide or in patients who are unable to tolerate such agents (5). It is also approved in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin for advanced, relapsed ovarian cancer. The most common adverse events associated with Tbt are myelosuppression, digestive toxicity (anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation), general condition decline and hepatic toxicity (hyperbilirubinemia, elevation of alanine aminotransferase or/and aspartate aminotransferase) (6). The approved summary of product characteristics mentions the need to monitor left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) before initiation and after treatment with Tbt, and recommend that an absolute decrease of LVEF \\\\u226515%, or \\\\u22655% if less than the lower limit of normal, should prompt drug discontinuation. These toxicities are believed to be present only in patients with ovarian cancer receiving previous or concomitant anthracyclines (7).
