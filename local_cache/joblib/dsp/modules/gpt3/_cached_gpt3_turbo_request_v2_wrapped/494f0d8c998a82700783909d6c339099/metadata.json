ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Haberland syndrome or encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis is a rare ectomesodermal dysgenesis defined by the triad including ocular, skin, and central nervous system involvement, which is commonly unilateral. This disorder is attributed to a post-zygotic mutation responsible for a neural tube and neural crest dysgenesis. We report the case of a 15-year-old female with Haberland syndrome with pharmacoresistant epilepsy who developed a World Health Organization-grade IV glioblastoma. This is the first case of pediatric glioblastoma associated with Haberland syndrome. The previously reported pediatric cases included benign brain tumors. To our knowledge, this is the fifth case of brain tumor associated with encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis and the second case of glioblastoma associated with this syndrome. The hypothesis that Haberland syndrome is associated with an increased risk of tumor development is intriguing, although the rarity of the condition is nowadays preventing us from drawing definitive conclusions about this potential link between the two entities. Further studies are needed to establish the real relationship between encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis and the risk of brain tumors. TEXT: Introduction Haberland syndrome or encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis is a rare ectomesodermal dysgenesis defined by the triad including ocular, skin, and central nervous system involvement, which is commonly unilateral (1). This disorder is attributed to a post-zygotic mutation responsible for a neural tube and neural crest dysgenesis (2). We report the case of an adolescent with Haberland syndrome who developed a glioblastoma. It is possible to hypothesize that Haberland syndrome, similarly to most of the neurocutaneous syndromes, is associated with a predisposition to cancer development. Case Description We describe the case of a 15-year-old female who was diagnosed with Haberland syndrome during infancy due to the presence of clinical signs including palpebral telangectasias, facial lipomas, angiomas of the trunk, scalp alopecia, scleral dermatolipomas, irideal abnormalities, and unilateral mandibular swelling. She also presented with severe mental and speech retardation and pharmacoresistant epilepsy. At the age of 18 months, she started to present with focal motor onset seizures with automatisms and impaired awareness. During early childhood, she presented with episodes of facial pallor, perioral cyanosis, and chewing automatisms without consciousness impairment. During school-age, focal non-motor onset autonomic aware seizures were observed. Therapy included combinations of Valproate, Topiramate, Phenobarbital, Delorazepam, Clonazepam, and Rufinamide.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Barbiturates, Urine barbiturates, Benzodiazepine drug level therapeutic, Benzodiazepine drug level, Urine barbiturates increased, Barbiturates positive, Urine barbiturates decreased, Barbiturates negative, Benzodiazepine drug level increased, Benzodiazepine drug level abnormal, Benzodiazepine drug level decreased, Sedative therapy, Off label use, Drug ineffective, Seizure, Anticonvulsant drug level, Anticonvulsant drug level therapeutic, Sedation, Anticonvulsant drug level increased, Anticonvulsant drug level above therapeutic, Urine delta aminolevulinate, Free fatty acids, Serum pristanic acid increased, Isovaleric acidaemia, Thrombocytopenia, Pyrexia, 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, Mevalonic aciduria, Aura, Clonus, Seizure prophylaxis, Blood bromide, Generalised tonic-clonic seizure, Clonic convulsion, Preictal state, Succinylacetone, Anticonvulsant drug level abnormal, Treatment failure, Anticonvulsant drug level below therapeutic, Depression, Free fatty acids decreased, Postictal depression, Renal impairment, Somnolence, Epileptic aura, Hydroxyprolinuria, Toxicity to various agents, Antidepressant drug clearance, Anxiolytic therapy, Hypersomnia\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
