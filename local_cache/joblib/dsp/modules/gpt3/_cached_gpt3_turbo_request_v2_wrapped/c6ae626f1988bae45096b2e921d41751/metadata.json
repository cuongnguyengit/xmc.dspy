The vacancy mentions a degree in \\\\\"Production Mechanical Electrical Marine Engineering (or similar)\\\\\" and the candidate might be \\\\\"newly educated.\\\\\" This suggests that the job requires a foundational understanding of engineering principles, particularly in the fields mentioned. Since the candidate might be newly educated, we can infer that the job may not require extensive experience but rather a solid educational background in the relevant engineering disciplines. We should look for skills that are related to mechanical, electrical, and marine engineering, as well as general engineering competencies that a recent graduate might possess.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: marine engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, operate mechanical equipment of ships, manage ship electrical systems, operate ship equipment, maintain shipboard machinery, maritime transportation technology, offshore constructions and facilities, provide support in vessel machinery systems\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: SQL experience is a plus but not required\\\\n\\\\nOptions: SQL, SQL Server, database, MySQL, use databases, PostgreSQL, Oracle Relational Database, data warehouse, database management systems, use query languages, query languages, manage database, Microsoft Access, operate relational database management system, database development tools, maintain database, data analytics, Teradata Database, CA Datacom/DB, business intelligence, Solidity, SPARQL, search databases, database quality standards, perform data mining, perform records management, data models, data mining, Drupal, maintain database performance, create data models, NoSQL, create database diagrams, manage quantitative data, implement data warehousing techniques, develop data processing applications, PHP, accounting, C#, design database scheme, SAP Data Services, DB2, use logic programming, manage data, data storage, balance database resources, SAS Data Management, perform data analysis, use accounting systems, use data processing techniques\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as beneficial for the job vacancy. The vacancy mentions \\\\\"SQL experience is a plus but not required,\\\\\" which suggests that while SQL skills are advantageous, they are not a mandatory requirement for the job. Therefore, we should focus on skills related to SQL and databases, as these are the most relevant to the statement provided.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: Skills: SQL, use databases, use query languages, query languages, manage database, database management systems, operate relational database management system, maintain database, create data models, manage data\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: You must have: - A valid driving license - The desire to work with pigs - A little experience with the job\\\\n\\\\nOptions: handle pigs, drive vehicles, perform defensive driving, develop an animal handling strategy, breed pigs, teach driving practices, livestock, apply advanced driving techniques, cut pig\\'s teeth, teach driving theory, handle working animals, drive in urban areas, meat industry, driving examinations, tend prepared animal feeds equipment, operate slaughterhouse equipment, operate meat processing equipment, livestock species, livestock feeding, slaughter animals, process livestock organs, protect health and safety when handling animals, manage the health and welfare of livestock, obey traffic rules, road traffic laws, feed livestock, animal welfare, regulations for hygiene in feeding animals, follow client animal handling programme, ensure animal welfare in slaughtering practices, manage livestock, apply animal hygiene practices, animal production science, livestock reproduction, select livestock, carry out humane harvesting practices, livestock farming systems, drive two-wheeled vehicles, manage mechanically controlled livestock production environments, ensure implementation of safe driving practices, tend meat processing production machines, manage animal welfare, inspect animal welfare management, cultural practices regarding animal parts sorting, documentation concerning meat production, animal recovery procedures, supervise animal handling for veterinary activities, operate in slaughterhouse installations, feed hoppers, make decisions regarding livestock management\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as necessary for the job vacancy. The vacancy states that the candidate must have \\\\\"A valid driving license,\\\\\" \\\\\"The desire to work with pigs,\\\\\" and \\\\\"A little experience with the job.\\\\\" From this, we can infer that the job requires the ability to drive, a willingness to work with pigs, and some prior experience in a related role. We should select skills that are related to driving and handling pigs, as well as general livestock management, since these are the most relevant to the vacancy.\\\\n\\\\nSkills:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706652494.4750226}
