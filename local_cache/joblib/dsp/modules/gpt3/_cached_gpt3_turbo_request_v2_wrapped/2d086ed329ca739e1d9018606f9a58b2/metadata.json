ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\\\\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\\\\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\\\\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \\\\u201cI think I\\\\u2019m having a stroke.\\\\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\\\\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Hypokalaemia, Anxiety, Hypomagnesaemia, Blood pressure increased, Hypotension, Hyponatraemia, Alcohol abuse, Hyperkalaemia, Hypocalcaemia, Alcohol use disorder, Blood potassium decreased, Alcoholism, Alcohol problem, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Drug abuse, Alcohol use, Anxiety disorder, Labile hypertension, Malignant hypertension, Hypokalaemic syndrome, Panic reaction, Alcoholic, Hypertensive urgency, Essential hypertension, Hypermagnesaemia, Nervousness, Urine potassium decreased, Alcohol poisoning, Panic disorder, Fear, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Alcoholic psychosis, Panic attack, Hypertensive angiopathy, Orthostatic hypertension, Generalised anxiety disorder, Alkalosis hypokalaemic, Electrolyte imbalance, Phobia, Alcoholic coma, Blood magnesium decreased, Idiosyncratic alcohol intoxication, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Renal hypertension, Blood alcohol, Prehypertension\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Over the last decades, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been widely used as the mainstay for treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal side effects, gastroesophageal reflux, and peptic ulcer disease. However, their safety profile has come into question recently after reports relating them to several side effects as well as kidney disease. Omeprazole, one of the mainly used PPIs, is almost entirely metabolized by the liver but the resulting metabolites are renally excreted. These metabolites may inhibit cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) reversibly, but as recent evidence suggests, they may also be involved in causing kidney disease. In the setting of renal dysfunction, these metabolites will not be excreted from the body and will accumulate further causing kidney damage and inhibiting CYP enzymes to a greater extent. Abnormally high serum prolactin levels leading to galactorrhea may be the result of such an accumulation. To our knowledge, there have been only three previously reported cases of PPI-induced galactorrhea in the literature but none in a kidney transplant recipient. In patients with established kidney disease and reduced glomerular filtration rate like kidney transplant recipients, the use of PPIs should be thoroughly assessed. Reduced clearance of their metabolites may lead to progression of the kidney disease and lead to more unwanted side effects. We present a case of a female kidney transplant recipient with worsening allograft function who presented with sudden galactorrhea and hyperprolactinemia while on a high-dose omeprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease. TEXT: 1. Introduction Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been one of the most extensively used medications in clinical practice over the last thirty years. They have been the mainstay in the treatment of acid-related disorders and in 2015 were ranked in the top ten United States health-related expenditures [1, 2]. PPIs irreversibly inhibit the H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) in gastric parietal cells, blocking acid production, and are recommended as empiric therapy for patients suspected of having gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) [3]. Omeprazole was the first drug approved in this class in 1989 and has been followed by five other PPIs including lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, and the stereoisomeric compounds dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole [4]. Due to their good safety profile, in 2003, omeprazole was the first approved PPI for public over-the-counter (OTC) use for the short-term (two weeks) management of heartburn.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Gastrooesophageal reflux disease, Hyperprolactinaemia, Galactorrhoea, Acute kidney injury, Renal transplant, Kidney transplant rejection, Macroprolactinaemia, Vomiting, Renal impairment, Duodenogastric reflux, Complications of transplanted kidney, Blood prolactin increased, Renal failure, Hyperpituitarism, Renal and liver transplant, Nausea, Renal transplant failure, Nasopharyngeal reflux, Lactation disorder, Dyspepsia, Pituitary gonadotropin hyperfunction, Removal of renal transplant, Renal and pancreas transplant, Hyperglycaemia, Ectopic prolactin secretion, Lactation normal, Breast engorgement, Suppressed lactation, Kidney anastomosis, Breast discharge, Oesophageal disorder, Pituitary hyperplasia, Renal and pancreas transplant rejection, Pituitary enlargement, Oesophageal motility disorder, Transplant, Nipple enlargement, Hyperreactio luteinalis, Diarrhoea, Renal surgery, Hyperglucagonaemia, Acute allograft nephropathy, Kidney transplant rupture, Reflux gastritis, Organ transplant, Blood prolactin abnormal, Nephroplasty, Pituitary-dependent Cushing\\'s syndrome, Galactostasis, Lactation puerperal increased\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
