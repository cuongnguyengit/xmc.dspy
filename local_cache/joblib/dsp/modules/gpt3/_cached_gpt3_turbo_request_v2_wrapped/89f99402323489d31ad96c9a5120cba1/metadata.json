ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Cytomegalovirus pneumonia in an immunosuppressed sarcoidosis patient; a rare case of cytomegalovirus infection in a sarcoidosis patient. ABSTRACT: Sarcoidosis is a multisystemic granulomatosis disease that is mostly treated with immunosuppressive regimens. Studies demonstrated that these patients are prone to develop various infections. However, some infections including viral severe pneumonia is rare complications in sarcoidosis patients. In the present report, we described for cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia in a female patient with sarcoidosis which has been successfully managed by ganciclovir. Herein, we present a known case of sarcoidosis admitted to the emergency department because of fever, dyspnea, and productive cough. The patient was receiving prednisolone and methotrexate for months. The primary chest x-ray imaging revealed bilateral infiltration, especially in the upper lobes and hilar lymphadenopathy. The lung high resolution computed tomography showed a bilateral diffuse nodular pattern. After 72 hours of antimicrobial treatment, the fever was still present and the patient became a candidate for fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The gram staining of the bronchial fluid, polymerase chain reaction for tuberculosis, and PCP was also unremarkable. However, the PCR-CMV was positive. The quantitative PCR for CMV form blood sample was taken and the result came back as 3.6*103. With the impression of CMV pneumonia, a daily dose of 5mg of ganciclovir was prescribed. After 3 weeks of receiving 5mg/kg of ganciclovir twice daily (600mg daily), clinical symptoms, and dyspnea improved. Also, the radiological findings improved. In the present report, we demonstrated that sarcoidosis patients\\' receiving immunosuppressives are prone to develop CMV pneumonia, and fever and dyspnea were the alarm signs of CMV pneumonia is our patient which was successfully managed by ganciclovir. TEXT: pmcSarcoidosis is a granulomatosis disease that is characterized by giant cell granuloma (1). The prevalence of sarcoidosis is reported to be 160 per 100000 individuals (2). Although the exact etiology of this multisystemic disease is not known; however, the overactive immune response to antigens is considered as a possible reason for the development of sarcoidosis (1). Sarcoidosis is usually an afebrile granulomatous disorder and the presence of fever mostly highlights a possible infection or malignancy (3). Treatment of sarcoidosis usually depends on glucocorticoids and cytotoxic drugs (1). Using immunosuppressive drugs affected these patients to develop opportunistic infections (1). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common pathogen causing interstitial pneumonia (4). CMV interstitial pneumonia could be a life-threatening infection in immunocompromised patients but is rarely reported in sarcoidosis patients (4). In the present report, we discussed a case of CMV pneumonia a sarcoidosis patient receiving immunosuppressants.
