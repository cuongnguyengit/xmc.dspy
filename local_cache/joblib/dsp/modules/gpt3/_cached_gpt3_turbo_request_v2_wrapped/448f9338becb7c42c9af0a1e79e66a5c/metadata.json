ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: We report a case of rhabdomyolysis and severe acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring dialysis in a 69-year-old male who was recently started on sitagliptin while on chronic simvastatin therapy. This potential interaction is not included in the package insert for sitagliptin. A comprehensive literature review revealed six previous reports of rhabdomyolysis due to drug interaction between sitagliptin and statins including simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin. Of these six cases, only two had developed rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI, none of which were severe enough to require dialysis. As patients are commonly prescribed statins and sitagliptin for treatment of dyslipidemia and diabetes, health care professionals should be aware of this potential drug interaction and closely monitor their patients for signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis and AKI. This case highlights the importance of conducting further studies on the risk of muscular toxicity of sitagliptin especially when administered concurrently with statins. TEXT: 1. Introduction Sitagliptin belongs to a class of oral antihyperglycemic drugs known as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors [1]. Statin use for management of dyslipidemia is common in patients with diabetes. We present a patient on long-term simvastatin therapy who developed severe rhabdomyolysis and AKI soon after starting treatment with sitagliptin. 2. Case Presentation A 69-year-old white male with history of hypertension, noninsulin-dependent diabetes, chronic kidney disease stage 3, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure was brought to hospital with complaints of generalized malaise, muscle weakness with pain in both his lower extremities, and inability to ambulate for last 4-5 days. He had developed these symptoms within 2 days of starting sitagliptin (Januvia 100 mg) therapy. His other medications included simvastatin, amlodipine, carvedilol, clopidogrel, gabapentin, glipizide, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, quinapril, and ezetimibe. He gave history of similar weakness when he was started on sitagliptin therapy few months ago, so he discontinued it by himself. His primary care physician however restarted it again at recent follow-up, when the patient refused insulin therapy.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Rhabdomyolysis, Diabetes mellitus, Dyslipidaemia, Hypo HDL cholesterolaemia, Diabetic ketoacidosis, Hyperglycaemia, Hypolipidaemia, Diabetic dyslipidaemia, Lipids decreased, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Acute kidney injury, Lipoprotein deficiency, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, High density lipoprotein decreased, Hypotriglyceridaemia, Low density lipoprotein decreased, Hypertriglyceridaemia, Pancreatogenous diabetes, Very low density lipoprotein decreased, Lipoprotein (a) decreased, Diabetes mellitus inadequate control, Blood cholesterol decreased, Blood triglycerides decreased, Lipid metabolism disorder, Apolipoprotein decreased, Hypocholesterolaemia, Non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased, Intermediate density lipoprotein decreased, Type 3 diabetes mellitus, Low density lipoprotein abnormal, Hyperlipidaemia, Diabetic metabolic decompensation, LDL/HDL ratio decreased, Diabetic complication, Chylomicron decreased, Monogenic diabetes, Hypoglycaemia, High density lipoprotein abnormal, Apolipoprotein B decreased, Ketosis-prone diabetes mellitus, Total cholesterol/HDL ratio decreased, Diarrhoea, Lipoprotein abnormal, Very low density lipoprotein abnormal, Low density lipoprotein increased, Hypercholesterolaemia, Decreased appetite, Weight decreased, Apolipoprotein A-I decreased, Lipids abnormal\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
