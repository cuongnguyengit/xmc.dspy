ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\\\\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\\\\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\\\\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \\\\u201cI think I\\\\u2019m having a stroke.\\\\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\\\\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Hypokalaemia, Anxiety, Hypomagnesaemia, Blood pressure increased, Hypotension, Hyponatraemia, Alcohol abuse, Hyperkalaemia, Hypocalcaemia, Alcohol use disorder, Blood potassium decreased, Alcoholism, Alcohol problem, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Drug abuse, Alcohol use, Anxiety disorder, Labile hypertension, Malignant hypertension, Hypokalaemic syndrome, Panic reaction, Alcoholic, Hypertensive urgency, Essential hypertension, Hypermagnesaemia, Nervousness, Urine potassium decreased, Alcohol poisoning, Panic disorder, Fear, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Alcoholic psychosis, Panic attack, Hypertensive angiopathy, Orthostatic hypertension, Generalised anxiety disorder, Alkalosis hypokalaemic, Electrolyte imbalance, Phobia, Alcoholic coma, Blood magnesium decreased, Idiosyncratic alcohol intoxication, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Renal hypertension, Blood alcohol, Prehypertension\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Patients with imaging findings concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage, however, with no evidence of hemorrhage following autopsy or cerebrospinal fluid testing are diagnosed with having pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage. A 73-year-old female presented to the emergency department with altered mental status one day after undergoing a lumbar epidural steroid injection at an outside hospital; a noncontrast computed tomography scan of the head revealed evidence of diffuse hyperdensity within the subarachnoid space concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging which demonstrated diffuse opacification of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces with gadolinium and the diagnoses of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage and gadolinium encephalopathy were made. The combination of the neurologic symptoms related to gadolinium encephalopathy and the radiographic findings of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage can create a clinical presentation nearly identical to ruptured aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patient history, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and temporal changes in computed tomography provide vital tools in establishing a diagnosis of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially after an iatrogenic intrathecal contrast administration. TEXT: Introduction Despite the 90% sensitivity and nearly 100% specificity of computed tomography of the head (CTH) in the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), false positives do occur [3,8,11]. Patients with imaging findings concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage, however, with no evidence of hemorrhage following autopsy or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing are diagnosed with having pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage (pSAH) [2,15]. Several etiologies of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage have been described including spontaneous intracranial hypotension, cerebral edema related to hypoxic-ischemic injury, cerebral/cerebellar infarction, subdural hemorrhage, meningeal infection, and hyperhemoglobinemia. Iatrogenic causes are less common, however, include patients following intrathecal, intravenous, or intra-arterial contrast administration [4,7,9,12,16]. This study includes a case description of a patient who presented with pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage and gadolinium encephalopathy following a lumbar epidural steroid injection and review of iatrogenic causes of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage following intrathecal administration of contrast.
