ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Parvovirus B19 (PVB19) infection has been implicated in allograft failure or dysfunction in solid organ transplantation (SOT) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), but the literature is limited. METHODS Two pediatric patients were diagnosed with PVB19 infection around the time of allo-HSCT graft failure. Both cases were secondary graft failure and required second allo-HSCT. CONCLUSIONS There are many risk factors and potential confounders in determining the exact etiology of graft failure after allo-HSCT. These two cases highlight the importance of including PVB19 in the diagnostic evaluation for graft failure. PVB19 infection may be an important risk factor for allo-HSCT graft failure. TEXT: pmc1 INTRODUCTION Parvovirus B19 (PVB19) is a single\\\\u2010stranded DNA virus that commonly infects young children and is self\\\\u2010limited in immunocompetent individuals with symptoms ranging from characteristic \\\\u201cslapped cheek\\\\u201d rash, viral exanthem, flu\\\\u2010like symptoms, arthralgias, and occasional pure red cell aplasia. 1 , 2 PVB19 has a predilection for erythroid progenitor cells which can result in pure red cell aplasia, but PVB19 has also been associated with transient aplastic crisis. 2 , 3 , 4 The exact mechanism of PVB19\\\\u2010associated bone marrow failure is not fully understood. Literature suggests that PVB19 has ability to replicate more efficiently in the relatively more hypoxic bone marrow microenvironment, leading to viral\\\\u2010induced bone marrow suppression. 3 While mild infection occurs in normal hosts, PVB19 infection in immunocompromised hosts has been associated with hepatitis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, chronic pure red cell aplasia, and allograft dysfunction after solid organ transplant (SOT) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo\\\\u2010HSCT). 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 PVB19\\\\u2010associated bone marrow graft failure has been rarely reported after allo\\\\u2010HSCT. 5 , 12 , 13 There are many risk factors and potential confounders in determining the exact etiology of graft failure after allo\\\\u2010HSCT. Thorough evaluation for the etiology of graft failure is critical to optimize treatment and outcomes for patients. We describe two pediatric cases of PVB19\\\\u2010associated graft failure after allo\\\\u2010HSCT, adding to the limited existing literature and highlighting the importance of inclusion of PVB19 in the diagnostic evaluation of graft failure. 2 CASE 2.1 Patient 1\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Pneumonia, Neutropenia, Bone marrow failure, Anaemia, Pneumonitis, Pancytopenia, Hepatitis, Myocarditis, Drug ineffective, Cytopenia, Aplasia pure red cell, Leukopenia, Parvovirus B19 infection, Thrombocytopenia, Solid organ transplant, Aplastic anaemia, Allogenic stem cell transplantation, Febrile neutropenia, Transplant failure, Transplant dysfunction, Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant, Organ transplant, Interstitial lung disease, Myocarditis infectious, Parvovirus infection, Drug-induced liver injury, Engraft failure, Transplant rejection, Graft loss, Delayed graft function, Carditis, Myocarditis post infection, Myeloid maturation arrest, Lung consolidation, Pure white cell aplasia, Treatment failure, Congenital aplastic anaemia, Stem cell transplant, Hepatitis acute, Agranulocytosis, Bone marrow ischaemia, Allogenic bone marrow transplantation therapy, Skin graft failure, Organ donor, Hepatitis E, Hepatitis C, Plasmablast count decreased, Liver disorder, Hepatitis H, Organising pneumonia\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653963.5236702}
