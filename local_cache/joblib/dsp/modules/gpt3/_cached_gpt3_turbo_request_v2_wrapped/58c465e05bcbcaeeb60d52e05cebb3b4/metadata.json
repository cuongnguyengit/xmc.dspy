ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Pneumomediastinum in COVID-19: A series of three cases and review of literature. ABSTRACT: Coronavirus disease-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Corona virus-2 is characterised by wide heterogeneity in clinical presentation. The typical radiographic findings in COVID-19 include bilateral ground-glass opacities and/or consolidations predominantly affecting the lower lobes and posterior segments of lungs. Other rare abnormal radiographic findings include pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum and pneumopericardium. There has been an increased incidence of pneumomediastinum, a rare but potentially life-threatening complication during this pandemic. It may be spontaneous or secondary. Pneumomediastinum may be due to barotrauma, cytokine storm induced diffuse alveolar injury or direct viral infection of type I and type II pneumocytes. The presence of pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 patients may indicate extensive alveolar membrane destruction and those patients need close monitoring. There are no consensus guidelines in managing COVID-19 patients with pneumomediastinum. Higher mortality rates (70.58%) are reported in intubated COVID-19 patients with pneumomediastinum. The development of pneumomediastinum in COVID-19 should be considered as a poor prognostic factor. TEXT: Introduction Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Corona virus-2 (SARS CoV-2) is characterised by wide heterogeneity in clinical presentation ranging from asymptomatic infection to critical and fatal illness. The lung is the primary target organ, and hypoxemic respiratory failure is the major complication in COVID-19 patients; other complications include that of cardiac, renal, neurologic, and haematological system. The characteristic haematological abnormalities of COVID-19 patients have prognostic implications, and it is very challenging in managing these haematological complications in COVID-19.1 There has been a significant increase in the number of intubations and need for mechanical ventilation during this pandemic and studies have shown that approximately 12%\\\\u201324% of hospitalised patients required endotracheal intubation.2,3 Pneumomediastinum (PM) also known as mediastinal emphysema is defined by the presence of air in the mediastinum. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum (SPM) was first described by Louis Hamman in the year 1939;4 hence, it is called as \\\\u2018Hamman Syndrome\\\\u2019. The incidence of SPM is reported to be 1 in 32,896.5 Chest pain, dyspnea, and subcutaneous emphysema are the most common clinical manifestations.6\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Respiratory failure, Pneumothorax, Pleural effusion, Renal impairment, Pneumomediastinum, Acute kidney injury, Cytokine storm, Endotracheal intubation, Barotrauma, Pneumopericardium, Mechanical ventilation, Respiratory distress, Renal failure, Pericardial effusion, Acute respiratory failure, Diffuse alveolar damage, Pneumothorax spontaneous, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Cardiac disorder, Haemothorax, Cardiac arrest, Cytokine release syndrome, Respiratory arrest, Respiratory depression, Pneumothorax traumatic, Pneumonia, Nervous system disorder, Hypoventilation, Hypoxia, Atelectasis, Hypotension, Dyspnoea, Cardiopulmonary failure, Renal disorder, Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Adaptive servo-ventilation, Cardiomyopathy, Sinus barotrauma, Nephropathy, Intermittent positive pressure breathing, Cardiac failure, Positive end-expiratory pressure, Septic shock, Interstitial lung disease, Arrhythmia, Tubulointerstitial nephritis, Pericarditis, Procedural pneumothorax, Acoustic shock, Pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653884.6236029}
