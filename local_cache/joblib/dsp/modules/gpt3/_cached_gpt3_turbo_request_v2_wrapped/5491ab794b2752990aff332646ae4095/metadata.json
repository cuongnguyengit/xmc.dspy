The vacancy mentions a degree in \\\\\"Production Mechanical Electrical Marine Engineering (or similar)\\\\\" and the candidate might be \\\\\"newly educated.\\\\\" This suggests that the job requires a foundational understanding of engineering principles, particularly in the fields mentioned. Since the candidate might be newly educated, we can infer that the job may not require extensive experience but rather a solid educational background in the relevant engineering disciplines. We should look for skills that are related to mechanical, electrical, and marine engineering, as well as general engineering competencies that a recent graduate might possess.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: marine engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, operate mechanical equipment of ships, manage ship electrical systems, operate ship equipment, maintain shipboard machinery, maritime transportation technology, offshore constructions and facilities, provide support in vessel machinery systems\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: SQL experience is a plus but not required\\\\n\\\\nOptions: SQL, SQL Server, database, MySQL, use databases, PostgreSQL, Oracle Relational Database, data warehouse, database management systems, use query languages, query languages, manage database, Microsoft Access, operate relational database management system, database development tools, maintain database, data analytics, Teradata Database, CA Datacom/DB, business intelligence, Solidity, SPARQL, search databases, database quality standards, perform data mining, perform records management, data models, data mining, Drupal, maintain database performance, create data models, NoSQL, create database diagrams, manage quantitative data, implement data warehousing techniques, develop data processing applications, PHP, accounting, C#, design database scheme, SAP Data Services, DB2, use logic programming, manage data, data storage, balance database resources, SAS Data Management, perform data analysis, use accounting systems, use data processing techniques\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as beneficial for the job vacancy. The vacancy mentions \\\\\"SQL experience is a plus but not required,\\\\\" which suggests that while SQL skills are advantageous, they are not a mandatory requirement for the job. Therefore, we should focus on skills related to SQL and databases, as these are the most relevant to the statement provided.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: Skills: SQL, use databases, use query languages, query languages, manage database, database management systems, operate relational database management system, maintain database, create data models, manage data\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: As part of <ORGANIZATION> the Transport & Handling Processes team is responsible for developing and illustrating processes and concepts related to transport installation and maintenance of wind turbines .\\\\n\\\\nOptions: maintain wind turbines, inspect wind turbines, provide information on wind turbines, design wind turbines, install machinery, design wind farm collector systems, types of wind turbines, maintain power plant machinery, install onshore wind energy systems, test wind turbine blades, maintain machinery, operate gas turbines, operation of transport equipment, maintain crane equipment, maintain aerodrome equipment, research locations for wind farms, perform maintenance on installed equipment, carry out maintenance on cage equipment and machinery, maintain mechanical equipment, install crane equipment, install electrical and electronic equipment, perform machine maintenance, install transport equipment engines, manage the operation of propulsion plant machinery, repair equipment on site, maintain power plants, install offshore renewable energy systems, manage heavy equipment, advise on machine maintenance, install utility equipment, maintain agricultural machinery, maintain industrial equipment, advise on equipment maintenance, carry out repairs and maintenance of vehicle bodies, maintain oil field machinery, ensure maintenance of railway machinery, ensure equipment maintenance, arrange equipment repairs, offshore constructions and facilities, design utility equipment, determine maintenance schedules for airport equipment, maintain amusement park equipment, inspect machinery, maintain rotating equipment, maintenance operations, maintain farm equipment, repair crane equipment, conduct routine machinery checks, maintain construction structures, guide operation of heavy construction equipment\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706652496.370504}
