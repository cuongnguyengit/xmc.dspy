ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Abdominal pain as an initial symptom of isolated ACTH deficiency induced by nivolumab in a patient with malignant mesothelioma. ABSTRACT: Used for a wide range of cancers, nivolumab has been reported to cause immune-related adverse events, including isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone deficiency (IAD). We report an 81-year-old woman with malignant mesothelioma who presented with abdominal pain after eight courses of nivolumab therapy, leading to the diagnosis of nivolumab-induced IAD. We should consider adrenal insufficiency (AI) when a patient on nivolumab complains of abdominal pain and has no other explanatory findings. Infusion-resistant hypotension and hyponatraemia can further suggest AI. TEXT: Background Nivolumab, an antibody that targets programmed cell death 1, is an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) that has been used for a wide range of cancers.1\\\\u20133 Despite superior clinical activity to chemotherapeutic agents, ICIs have been increasingly reported to cause various types of immune-related adverse events (irAEs).2 4\\\\u20137 Isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency (IAD), a rare disorder categorised as secondary adrenal insufficiency (AI), has been reported as an irAE caused by ICIs. The symptoms of IAD, such as general fatigue, anorexia, weight loss and nausea, are non-specific, which may delay diagnosis.8 Here, we report nivolumab-induced IAD in a patient with malignant mesothelioma who had abdominal pain as an initial symptom. Case presentation An 81-year-old woman with a history of Graves\\\\u2019 disease, treated with both levothyroxine 50 \\\\u00b5g and thiamazole 5 mg, was diagnosed with stage IIIB malignant mesothelioma in 2017. She underwent chemotherapy with carboplatin and pemetrexed for 10 courses. As disease progression was observed during chemotherapy, nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) was initiated in October 2018. In January 2019, after the eighth course of nivolumab treatment, the patient underwent laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy for sigmoid colon cancer. During the perioperative period, nivolumab administration was continued. Just after the surgery, she noted mild intermittent abdominal pain, which continued for 2 months. An abdominal CT scan was performed but showed no causative abnormalities, even at the surgical sites. Two weeks later, just after the 12th course of nivolumab, the patient visited an emergency department and complained of worse abdominal pain and general fatigue. On physical examination, her level of consciousness was normal, and her vital signs were as follows: blood pressure 88/77 mm Hg, pulse rate 115 beats per minute, SpO2 95% on ambient air, respiratory rate 16 per minute, and body temperature 37.2\\\\u00b0C. Even after infusion of 1.5 litres of intravenous physiologic saline, her blood pressure remained around 100/80 mm Hg. Vasopressor drugs were not used. Abdominal examination showed tenderness in the right lower quadrant without signs of peritoneal irritation. The physical examination was otherwise normal.

The article discusses a case of an 81-year-old woman with malignant mesothelioma who developed abdominal pain after receiving nivolumab therapy, which led to the diagnosis of nivolumab-induced isolated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency (IAD). The article mentions that the symptoms of IAD include general fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, and nausea. It also describes the patient\\'s presentation with abdominal pain, general fatigue, and hypotension that was resistant to infusion, as well as hyponatraemia. These details help us identify the adverse reactions experienced by the patient.\\\\n\\\\nReactions:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706654013.5207596}
