ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \\\\\"found down\\\\\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \\\\u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \\\\u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\\\\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\\\\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \\\\u201ccatch up\\\\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Insomnia, Compartment syndrome, Crush syndrome, Somnolence, Acute kidney injury, Fatigue, Sleep disorder, Sleep deficit, Poor quality sleep, Sleep inertia, Sleep terror, Irregular sleep phase, Behavioural induced insufficient sleep syndrome, Middle insomnia, Parasomnia, Dyssomnia, Terminal insomnia, Abnormal sleep-related event, Abdominal compartment syndrome, Delayed sleep phase, Psychophysiologic insomnia, Paradoxical insomnia, Advanced sleep phase, Somnambulism, Crush injury, Sleep attacks, Sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, Hyposomnia, Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, Orbital compartment syndrome, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition insomnia type, Condition aggravated, Initial insomnia, Irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition parasomnia type, Hypersomnia, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition mixed type, Myalgia, Bedridden, Behavioural insomnia of childhood, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition hypersomnia type, Decompression sickness, Breathing-related sleep disorder, Loss of dreaming, Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Rapid eye movements sleep abnormal, Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Lethargy, Crushing injury of trunk, Sudden onset of sleep\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Over the last decades, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been widely used as the mainstay for treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal side effects, gastroesophageal reflux, and peptic ulcer disease. However, their safety profile has come into question recently after reports relating them to several side effects as well as kidney disease. Omeprazole, one of the mainly used PPIs, is almost entirely metabolized by the liver but the resulting metabolites are renally excreted. These metabolites may inhibit cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) reversibly, but as recent evidence suggests, they may also be involved in causing kidney disease. In the setting of renal dysfunction, these metabolites will not be excreted from the body and will accumulate further causing kidney damage and inhibiting CYP enzymes to a greater extent. Abnormally high serum prolactin levels leading to galactorrhea may be the result of such an accumulation. To our knowledge, there have been only three previously reported cases of PPI-induced galactorrhea in the literature but none in a kidney transplant recipient. In patients with established kidney disease and reduced glomerular filtration rate like kidney transplant recipients, the use of PPIs should be thoroughly assessed. Reduced clearance of their metabolites may lead to progression of the kidney disease and lead to more unwanted side effects. We present a case of a female kidney transplant recipient with worsening allograft function who presented with sudden galactorrhea and hyperprolactinemia while on a high-dose omeprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease. TEXT: 1. Introduction Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been one of the most extensively used medications in clinical practice over the last thirty years. They have been the mainstay in the treatment of acid-related disorders and in 2015 were ranked in the top ten United States health-related expenditures [1, 2]. PPIs irreversibly inhibit the H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) in gastric parietal cells, blocking acid production, and are recommended as empiric therapy for patients suspected of having gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) [3]. Omeprazole was the first drug approved in this class in 1989 and has been followed by five other PPIs including lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, and the stereoisomeric compounds dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole [4]. Due to their good safety profile, in 2003, omeprazole was the first approved PPI for public over-the-counter (OTC) use for the short-term (two weeks) management of heartburn.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hyperprolactinaemia, Galactorrhoea, Acute kidney injury, Renal transplant, Kidney transplant rejection, Macroprolactinaemia, Renal impairment, Complications of transplanted kidney, Blood prolactin increased, Renal failure, Hyperpituitarism, Renal and liver transplant, Renal transplant failure, Lactation disorder, Pituitary gonadotropin hyperfunction, Removal of renal transplant, Renal and pancreas transplant, Hyperglycaemia, Ectopic prolactin secretion, Vomiting, Lactation normal, Breast engorgement, Nausea, Suppressed lactation, Kidney anastomosis, Breast discharge, Pituitary hyperplasia, Renal and pancreas transplant rejection, Pituitary enlargement, Transplant, Nipple enlargement, Hyperreactio luteinalis, Renal surgery, Hyperglucagonaemia, Acute allograft nephropathy, Kidney transplant rupture, Organ transplant, Blood prolactin abnormal, Nephroplasty, Pituitary-dependent Cushing\\'s syndrome, Galactostasis, Lactation puerperal increased, Amenorrhoea-galactorrhoea syndrome, Blood prolactin, Chronic allograft nephropathy, Renal replacement therapy, Decreased appetite, Renal transplant torsion, Cushing\\'s syndrome, Organ donor\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653578.7190685}
