ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \\\\\"found down\\\\\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \\\\u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \\\\u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\\\\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\\\\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \\\\u201ccatch up\\\\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Insomnia, Compartment syndrome, Crush syndrome, Somnolence, Acute kidney injury, Fatigue, Sleep disorder, Sleep deficit, Poor quality sleep, Sleep inertia, Sleep terror, Irregular sleep phase, Behavioural induced insufficient sleep syndrome, Middle insomnia, Parasomnia, Dyssomnia, Terminal insomnia, Abnormal sleep-related event, Abdominal compartment syndrome, Delayed sleep phase, Psychophysiologic insomnia, Paradoxical insomnia, Advanced sleep phase, Somnambulism, Crush injury, Sleep attacks, Sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, Hyposomnia, Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, Orbital compartment syndrome, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition insomnia type, Condition aggravated, Initial insomnia, Irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition parasomnia type, Hypersomnia, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition mixed type, Myalgia, Bedridden, Behavioural insomnia of childhood, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition hypersomnia type, Decompression sickness, Breathing-related sleep disorder, Loss of dreaming, Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Rapid eye movements sleep abnormal, Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Lethargy, Crushing injury of trunk, Sudden onset of sleep\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Hodgkin\\'s disease is recognized as part of the spectrum of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), although it is still an uncommon de novo malignancy in this population. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been linked to both post-transplant non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphomas and Hodgkin\\'s disease. We report a case of recurrent Hodgkin\\'s disease in a patient who received a renal transplant in childhood and later developed EBV-associated Hodgkin\\'s disease with remission after chemotherapy until subsequent relapse 9 years later that was successfully treated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of recurrent Hodgkin\\'s disease in a transplant recipient. We briefly discuss the pathogenesis of and risk factors for EBV-related PTLD, utility of EBV load surveillance, and the options for treatment of PTLD including immunosuppression reduction, antiviral therapy, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, cytotoxic T cells, and the possible roles of interferon-alpha and rapamycin. TEXT: Case report The patient is a 27-year-old white man who received a living-related donor transplant from his father at 11 years of age in 1986 for end stage renal disease secondary to posterior urethral valves. The patient was seronegative for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein\\\\u2013Barr virus (EBV) prior to transplantation. His father\\'s EBV and CMV status were unavailable. The transplant course was complicated by immediate postoperative acute renal artery thrombosis, which required transplant nephrectomy. He then received a deceased donor renal transplant 10 days later. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (Sandimmune formulation), azathioprine, and prednisone. He received 12 doses of Minnesota equine antilymphocyte immunoglobulin (MALG) for induction followed by 10 doses of murine anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) for two episodes of acute graft rejection over the 7 weeks following the transplant. The deceased donor\\'s EBV and CMV status were unavailable from medical records. The patient developed acute infectious mononucleosis 2 months after transplantation demonstrated by positive EBV serology. He was treated with acyclovir and the infectious mononucleosis resolved. At the age of 18, he presented with 5 months of fever, weight-loss and night sweats, and was found to have axillary adenopathy, splenomegaly and bulky right mediastinal adenopathy. A right anterior, thoracotomy and lymph node biopsy demonstrated Hodgkin\\'s disease, nodular sclerosing subtype. Hodgkin\\'s\\\\u2013Reed\\\\u2013Sternberg (HRS) cells were strongly positive for CD30 and EBV-latent membrane protein (LMP)-1. He was staged as Hodgkin\\'s disease-IIIB. His EBV serology demonstrated elevated antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG titers and positive anti-VCA IgM, consistent with reactivation of EBV infection.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, Hodgkin\\'s disease, Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, Lymphoproliferative disorder, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type stage unspecified, Hodgkin\\'s disease recurrent, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion type stage unspecified, Epstein-Barr virus infection, Hodgkin\\'s disease mixed cellularity stage unspecified, Disease progression, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type recurrent, Hodgkin\\'s disease stage III, Alpha interferon therapy, Hodgkin\\'s disease mixed cellularity recurrent, Hodgkin\\'s disease unclassifiable, Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphoproliferative disorder, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion type recurrent, Hodgkin\\'s disease stage IV, Hodgkin\\'s disease stage II, Lymphoma, Interferon therapy, Lymphoproliferative disorder in remission, Hodgkin\\'s disease stage I, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type stage III, Hodgkin\\'s disease nodular sclerosis recurrent, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance stage II site unspec, Beta interferon therapy, Malignant lymphoid neoplasm, Disease recurrence, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type stage IV, Gamma interferon therapy, Anti-interferon antibody, Cytomegalovirus infection, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance stage I site unspec, Hodgkin\\'s disease nodular sclerosis, Interferon alpha level, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type refractory, High grade B-cell lymphoma Burkitt-like lymphoma recurrent, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion stage II site unspecified, Epstein-Barr virus antibody, Graft versus host disease, B-cell lymphoma recurrent, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion type stage III, Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphoma, Hodgkin\\'s disease refractory, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion stage I site unspecified, Hodgkin\\'s disease mixed cellularity stage III, Interferon beta level, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion type stage IV, Hodgkin\\'s disease mixed cellularity stage I site unspecified\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653516.5034847}
