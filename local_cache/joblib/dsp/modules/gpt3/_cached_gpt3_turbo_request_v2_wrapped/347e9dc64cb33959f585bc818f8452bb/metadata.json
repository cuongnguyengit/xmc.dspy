ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: The present study aimed at evaluating whether a weekly cisplatin, epirubicin, and paclitaxel (PET) regimen could increase the pathological complete response (pCR) rate in comparison with a tri-weekly epirubicin and paclitaxel administration in locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) patients. Patients with stage IIIB disease were randomised to receive either 12 weekly cycles of cisplatin 30 mg m(-2), epirubicin 50 mg m(-2), and paclitaxel 120 mg m(-2) (PET) plus granulocyte-colony stimulating factor support, or four cycles of epirubicin 90 mg m(-2)+paclitaxel 175 mg m(-2) (ET) every 3 weeks. Overall, 200 patients (PET/ET=100/100) were included in this study. A pCR in both breast and axilla occurred in 16 (16%) PET patients and in six (6%) ET patients (P=0.02). The higher activity of PET was evident only in ER negative (27.5 vs 5.4%; P=0.026), and in HER/neu positive (31 vs 5%; P=0.037) tumours. The two arms yielded similar pCR rate in ER positive (PET/ET=7.5/7.1%) and HER/neu negative (PET/ET=10/6%) patients. At a 39 months median follow-up, 70 patients showed a progression or relapses (PET, 32 vs ET, 38). Anaemia, mucositis, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal toxicity were substantially more frequent in the PET arm. The PET weekly regimen is superior to ET in terms of pCR rate in LABC patients with ER negative and/or HER2 positive tumours Mature data in terms of disease-free and overall survival are needed to ascertain whether this approach could improve the prognosis of these subsets of LABC patients. TEXT: pmcThe role of chemotherapy in improving the prognosis of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) patients is widely recognised. High objective response rates can be achieved with standard combination chemotherapy, rendering in most cases the tumour operable at the end of the treatment (Hortobagyi and Buzdar, 1997). Primary chemotherapy is also becoming very popular in patients with operable disease at diagnosis, since it permits a substantial increase in the rate of breast-sparing surgery, and allows an early pathological evaluation of the effect of treatment. The absence of residual tumour in both breast and axilla is associated with a much lower risk of relapse (Chollet et al, 2002; Faneyete et al, 2003). Unfortunately, the chance of achieving such a goal in women with LABC is low. Indeed, in the NSABP-B18 trial, the pCR rate after primary chemotherapy was <3% in women with T3 (operable) disease (Fisher et al, 1997). During the last decade, several new drugs with different mechanisms of action have been introduced into clinical practice. Among them, the taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) have raised great enthusiasm, and have been rapidly incorporated in combination regimens (Dombernowsky et al, 1996; Moliterni et al, 1997).\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Anaemia, Neuropathy peripheral, Mucosal inflammation, Gastrointestinal toxicity, Peripheral sensory neuropathy, Haemoglobin decreased, Peripheral motor neuropathy, Peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, Polyneuropathy, Stomatitis, Neuronal neuropathy, Deficiency anaemia, Toxicity to various agents, Diarrhoea, Pancytopenia, Microcytic anaemia, Normocytic anaemia, Normochromic normocytic anaemia, Peripheral nerve lesion, Nausea, Anaemia of chronic disease, Vomiting, Normochromic anaemia, Red blood cell count decreased, Gastrointestinal disorder, Mucosal ulceration, Bone marrow failure, Neutropenia, Anaemia of malignant disease, Mucosal infection, Aplastic anaemia, Erythropenia, Mononeuropathy, Hypoplastic anaemia, Leukoerythroblastic anaemia, Mononeuropathy multiplex, Blood loss anaemia, Small fibre neuropathy, Hypochromic anaemia, Mucosal disorder, Haemolytic anaemia, Iron deficiency anaemia, Nephrogenic anaemia, Erythroblast count decreased, Nerve degeneration, Demyelinating polyneuropathy, Axonal neuropathy, Gastrointestinal inflammation, Polyneuropathy idiopathic progressive, Polyneuropathy chronic\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
