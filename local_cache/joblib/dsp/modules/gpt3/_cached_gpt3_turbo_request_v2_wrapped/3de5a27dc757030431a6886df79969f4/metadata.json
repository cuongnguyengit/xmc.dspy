ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage and gadolinium encephalopathy following lumbar epidural steroid injection. ABSTRACT: Patients with imaging findings concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage, however, with no evidence of hemorrhage following autopsy or cerebrospinal fluid testing are diagnosed with having pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage. A 73-year-old female presented to the emergency department with altered mental status one day after undergoing a lumbar epidural steroid injection at an outside hospital; a noncontrast computed tomography scan of the head revealed evidence of diffuse hyperdensity within the subarachnoid space concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging which demonstrated diffuse opacification of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces with gadolinium and the diagnoses of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage and gadolinium encephalopathy were made. The combination of the neurologic symptoms related to gadolinium encephalopathy and the radiographic findings of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage can create a clinical presentation nearly identical to ruptured aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patient history, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and temporal changes in computed tomography provide vital tools in establishing a diagnosis of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially after an iatrogenic intrathecal contrast administration. TEXT: Introduction Despite the 90% sensitivity and nearly 100% specificity of computed tomography of the head (CTH) in the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), false positives do occur [3,8,11]. Patients with imaging findings concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage, however, with no evidence of hemorrhage following autopsy or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing are diagnosed with having pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage (pSAH) [2,15]. Several etiologies of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage have been described including spontaneous intracranial hypotension, cerebral edema related to hypoxic-ischemic injury, cerebral/cerebellar infarction, subdural hemorrhage, meningeal infection, and hyperhemoglobinemia. Iatrogenic causes are less common, however, include patients following intrathecal, intravenous, or intra-arterial contrast administration [4,7,9,12,16]. This study includes a case description of a patient who presented with pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage and gadolinium encephalopathy following a lumbar epidural steroid injection and review of iatrogenic causes of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage following intrathecal administration of contrast.
