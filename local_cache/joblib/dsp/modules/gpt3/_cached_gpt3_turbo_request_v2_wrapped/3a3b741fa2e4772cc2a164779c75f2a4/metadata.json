ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Neoadjuvant programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy in resectable non-small cell lung cancer: an open-label, multicenter, single-arm study. ABSTRACT: Neoadjuvant therapy has significantly improved the 5-year overall survival (OS) of patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The CheckMate 159 trial showed that neoadjuvant therapy with a single-drug programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor (nivolumab) achieved major pathological response (MPR) and pathological complete response (pCR) in 45% and 15%of participants, respectively. We conducted an open-label single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of resectable NSCLC. This study was conducted in a total of 2 hospitals in the Chinese cities of Xi\\'an and Chongqing, and included eligible patients over 18 years of age with clinically staged IIA-IIIB NSCLC. All patients were scheduled to receive surgery within 4-6 weeks after neoadjuvant treatment (3-4 cycles) consisting of PD-1 inhibitors combined with a conventional chemotherapy regimen on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Twenty-three patients, 22 males, and 1 female with just one of them with no smoking habits) were diagnosed with NSCL C in a stage IIA (3 cases), IIB (3 cases), IIIA (8 cases), and IIIB (9cases) and no druggable driver mutations/translocations were addressed to receive neoadjuvant treatment between June 2018 and June 2020. The treatment was well tolerated with just 3 typical immune-related adverse events (hyperthyroidism, hyperglycemia, and rash) recorded. There was a partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) in 17 (73.9%) and 6 (26.1%) patients, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 73.9% according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v.1.1). Six of these patients resulted in pCR (30%) while ten of them showed a MPR (50%). Twenty patients underwent surgical resection after treatment, while further 3 refused surgery. Surgical procedure included video-assisted thoracoscopic resection (10 cases), Vinci Robot surgery (4 cases), and thoracotomy in 4 cases while there were secondary compliance-related thoracotomy in two cases. The pathology analysis revealed a R0 in 19 cases (19/20, 95%). Our results suggest that the neoadjuvant approach with chemotherapy and PD-1 blocking mAbs is safe and active in patients with resectable NSCLC where is associated with a promising high ORR, MPR and pCR.
