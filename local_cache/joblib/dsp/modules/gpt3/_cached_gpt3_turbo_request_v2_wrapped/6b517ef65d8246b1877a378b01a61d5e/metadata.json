ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Experience with angiotensin-receptor neprilysin inhibitors (ARNI) in oncologic patients with heart failure (HF) is limited. We report a case of ARNI started as first-choice therapy in a patient with relapsing hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and HF with depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). A middle-aged male, previously treated with rituximab for HCL, was scheduled for cardiologic screening before starting a new antineoplastic therapy for cancer relapse. The patient had symptomatic HF with reduced LVEF and high NT-proBNP levels. In this patient, early ARNI treatment was well tolerated and produced a rapid and durable improvement of symptoms, LVEF and NT-proBNP levels. Consequently, the oncologic team could start an experimental treatment with obinutuzumab, with complete HCL remission. In conclusion, in this patient with HCL and HF, ARNI therapy was safe and effective, contributing to undelayed cancer treatment. TEXT: Introduction In the PARADIGM-HF study, the angiotensin-receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) sacubitril/valsartan was superior to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition in decreasing both mortality and hospitalisation rates in symptomatic patients with heart failure and depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF).1 However, in PARADIGM-HF, only stable patients in therapy with ACE inhibitors were eligible to join the study and patients with active oncologic disorders were substantially excluded from the study due to their short life expectancy. Oncologic patients often suffer from (HFrEF), mainly due to the cardiotoxicity of antineoplastic treatments,2 and many of them carry a significant lifetime risk of death or hospitalisation for heart failure.3 Moreover, a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) often precludes patients with cancer from receiving full doses and complete courses of antineoplastic treatments.4 Thus, oncologic patients with HFrEF might benefit from the addition of ARNI to their heart failure treatment, and early ARNI administration might be of great value to prevent irreversible myocardial damage and to allow more patients to complete their antineoplastic drug schedule. Unfortunately, data on tolerability and outcomes of oncologic patients with HFrEF treated with ARNI are lacking. Case report A 45-year-old Caucasian male underwent cardiologic screening before starting a new antineoplastic treatment for relapsing hairy cell leukaemia (HCL). The patient was diagnosed with HCL in 2014 and had been treated with cladribine (continuous infusion of 0.09 mg/kg for 7 days) followed by rituximab (8 cycles of 375 ml/m2) with complete clinical remission. At that time, baseline and follow up echocardiography were unremarkable.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Cardiac failure, Cardiac failure congestive, Ejection fraction decreased, Hairy cell leukaemia, Left ventricular dysfunction, Disease progression, Cardiac disorder, Cardiomyopathy, Renin-angiotensin system inhibition, Leukaemia, Cardiac failure acute, Malignant neoplasm progression, Lymphocytic leukaemia, Cardiac failure high output, Decreased ventricular afterload, Hypotension, Cardiac dysfunction, Leukaemic lymphoma, Lymphoid leukaemia (in remission), Decreased ventricular preload, Right ventricular ejection fraction decreased, Cardiovascular disorder, Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (in remission), Hairy cell leukaemia recurrent, Congestive cardiomyopathy, Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, Cardiac ventricular disorder, Cardiomegaly, Leukaemia granulocytic, Ventricular hypokinesia, Cardiac failure chronic, Ventricular compliance decreased, Chronic leukaemia, Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased, Ventricular failure, Aleukaemic leukaemia, Left ventricular failure, Ejection fraction abnormal, Angiotensin I, Right ventricular failure, Angiotensin converting enzyme decreased, Ventricular dysfunction, Ejection fraction, Cardiogenic shock, Low cardiac output syndrome, Dyspnoea, Leukaemia basophilic, Oedema due to cardiac disease, Acute lymphocytic leukaemia, Enzyme inhibition\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
