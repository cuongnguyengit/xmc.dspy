The vacancy mentions a degree in \\\\\"Production Mechanical Electrical Marine Engineering (or similar)\\\\\" and the candidate might be \\\\\"newly educated.\\\\\" This suggests that the job requires a foundational understanding of engineering principles, particularly in the fields mentioned. Since the candidate might be newly educated, we can infer that the job may not require extensive experience but rather a solid educational background in the relevant engineering disciplines. We should look for skills that are related to mechanical, electrical, and marine engineering, as well as general engineering competencies that a recent graduate might possess.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: marine engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, operate mechanical equipment of ships, manage ship electrical systems, operate ship equipment, maintain shipboard machinery, maritime transportation technology, offshore constructions and facilities, provide support in vessel machinery systems\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: SQL experience is a plus but not required\\\\n\\\\nOptions: SQL, SQL Server, database, MySQL, use databases, PostgreSQL, Oracle Relational Database, data warehouse, database management systems, use query languages, query languages, manage database, Microsoft Access, operate relational database management system, database development tools, maintain database, data analytics, Teradata Database, CA Datacom/DB, business intelligence, Solidity, SPARQL, search databases, database quality standards, perform data mining, perform records management, data models, data mining, Drupal, maintain database performance, create data models, NoSQL, create database diagrams, manage quantitative data, implement data warehousing techniques, develop data processing applications, PHP, accounting, C#, design database scheme, SAP Data Services, DB2, use logic programming, manage data, data storage, balance database resources, SAS Data Management, perform data analysis, use accounting systems, use data processing techniques\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as beneficial for the job vacancy. The vacancy mentions \\\\\"SQL experience is a plus but not required,\\\\\" which suggests that while SQL skills are advantageous, they are not a mandatory requirement for the job. Therefore, we should focus on skills related to SQL and databases, as these are the most relevant to the statement provided.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: Skills: SQL, use databases, use query languages, query languages, manage database, database management systems, operate relational database management system, maintain database, create data models, manage data\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: The successful candidate will be expected to independently conduct the experimental work in this project .\\\\n\\\\nOptions: gather experimental data, perform studies and field investigation, perform laboratory investigations, laboratory-based sciences, laboratory techniques, conduct field work, perform scientific research, perform laboratory tests, use laboratory equipment, laboratory equipment, present exhibition, perform field research, perform chemical experiments, assist scientific research, apply scientific methods, conduct experiments on animals, design prototypes, formulate findings, metrology, occupational science, good laboratory practice, contact scientists, perform scientific experiments in space, produce samples, applied zoology, test materials, analyse experimental laboratory data, research new photographic procedures, technical drawings, carry out scientific research in observatory, participant observation, medical studies, research human behaviour, use testing equipment, conduct regular aviation research, collect samples, assist in the production of laboratory documentation, disseminate results to the scientific community, prepare optical laboratory activities, evaluate research activities, test procedures, carry out geological explorations, engineering processes, metalworking, scientific research methodology, apply knowledge of science technology and engineering, archaeology, demonstrate curiosity, use measurement instruments, chemistry\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706652495.0450795}
