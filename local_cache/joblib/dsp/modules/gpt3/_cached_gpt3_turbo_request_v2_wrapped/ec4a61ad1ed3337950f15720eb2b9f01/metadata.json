ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Combination of Decitabine and a Modified Regimen of Cisplatin, Cytarabine and Dexamethasone: A Potential Salvage Regimen for Relapsed or Refractory Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma After Second-Line Treatment Failure. ABSTRACT: The prognosis for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (R/R-DLBCL) after second-line treatment failure is extremely poor. This study prospectively observed the efficacy and safety of decitabine with a modified cisplatin, cytarabine, and dexamethasone (DHAP) regimen in R/R-DLBCL patients who failed second-line treatment. Twenty-one R/R-DLBCL patients were enrolled and treated with decitabine and a modified DHAP regimen. The primary endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) and safety. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). ORR reached 50% (complete response rate, 35%), five patients (25%) had stable disease (SD) with disease control rate (DCR) of 75%. Subgroup analysis revealed patients over fifty years old had a higher complete response rate compared to younger patients (P = 0.005), and relapsed patients had a better complete response rate than refractory patients (P = 0.031). Median PFS was 7 months (95% confidence interval, 5.1-8.9 months). Median OS was not achieved. One-year OS was 59.0% (95% CI, 35.5%-82.5%), and two-year OS was 51.6% (95% confidence interval, 26.9%-76.3%). The main adverse events (AEs) were grade 3/4 hematologic toxicities such as neutropenia (90%), anemia (50%), and thrombocytopenia (70%). Other main non-hematologic AEs were grade 1/2 nausea/vomiting (40%) and infection (50%). No renal toxicity or treatment-related death occurred. Decitabine with a modified DHAP regimen can improve the treatment response and prognosis of R/R-DLBCL patients with good tolerance to AEs, suggesting this regimen has potential as a possible new treatment option for R/R-DLBCL patients after second-line treatment failure. ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier: NCT03579082. TEXT: Introduction Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common and aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (1). Standard immunochemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone, and rituximab) successfully treats 60\\\\u201370% of patients, with the remainder progressing or relapsing (2). The efficacy of second-line treatments, such as rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (R-ICE), rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin (R-DHAP), rituximab, etoposide, dexamethasone, cytarabine, cisplatin (R-ESHAP), and rituximab, gemcitabine, dexamethasone, cisplatin (R-GDP), etc., has no difference to each other for patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma (R/R-DLBCL) (3). The effectiveness of salvage regimen in patients who failed second-line therapy and consolidative high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell rescue (HDT/ASCR) in 12 months was 20% to 30%, with an average overall survival (OS) of 6 to 10 months (4, 5).\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Thrombocytopenia, Neutropenia, Nausea, Anaemia, Vomiting, Infection, Febrile neutropenia, Leukopenia, Pancytopenia, Platelet count decreased, Diarrhoea, Agranulocytosis, Haemoglobin decreased, Neutrophil count decreased, Bone marrow failure, Granulocytopenia, Sepsis, Immune thrombocytopenia, Cytopenia, Deficiency anaemia, Thrombocytopenic purpura, Abdominal pain, Neutropenic sepsis, White blood cell count decreased, Neutrophil percentage decreased, Microcytic anaemia, Thrombocytosis, Idiopathic neutropenia, Lymphopenia, Normocytic anaemia, Cyclic neutropenia, Autoimmune neutropenia, Anaemia of chronic disease, Vomiting projectile, Band neutrophil count decreased, Neutrophil function disorder, Granulocyte count decreased, Normochromic normocytic anaemia, Normochromic anaemia, Anaemia of malignant disease, Red blood cell count decreased, Pure white cell aplasia, Headache, Aplastic anaemia, Vomiting psychogenic, Benign ethnic neutropenia, Leukoerythroblastic anaemia, Platelet disorder, Erythropenia, Hypoplastic anaemia\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
