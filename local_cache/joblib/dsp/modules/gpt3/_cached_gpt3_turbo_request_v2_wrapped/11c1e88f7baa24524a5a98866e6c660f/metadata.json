ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \\\\\"found down\\\\\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \\\\u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \\\\u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\\\\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\\\\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \\\\u201ccatch up\\\\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Insomnia, Compartment syndrome, Crush syndrome, Somnolence, Acute kidney injury, Fatigue, Sleep disorder, Sleep deficit, Poor quality sleep, Sleep inertia, Sleep terror, Irregular sleep phase, Behavioural induced insufficient sleep syndrome, Middle insomnia, Parasomnia, Dyssomnia, Terminal insomnia, Abnormal sleep-related event, Abdominal compartment syndrome, Delayed sleep phase, Psychophysiologic insomnia, Paradoxical insomnia, Advanced sleep phase, Somnambulism, Crush injury, Sleep attacks, Sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, Hyposomnia, Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, Orbital compartment syndrome, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition insomnia type, Condition aggravated, Initial insomnia, Irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition parasomnia type, Hypersomnia, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition mixed type, Myalgia, Bedridden, Behavioural insomnia of childhood, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition hypersomnia type, Decompression sickness, Breathing-related sleep disorder, Loss of dreaming, Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Rapid eye movements sleep abnormal, Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Lethargy, Crushing injury of trunk, Sudden onset of sleep\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Endoscopic shielding is an innovative concept in therapeutic endoscopy. Its usage has been mostly restricted to wide-field endoscopic mucosal resection and/or endoscopic submucosal dissection. A novel potential clinical use may be in bleeding pophylaxis for argon plasma coagulation-related ulcers under concomitant mandatory dual antiplatelet therapy. TEXT: While in broad clinical use in many fields of surgery, endoscopic shielding is considered quite a novel concept in interventional endoscopy, for example, for large postresectional lesions [endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and/or endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR)], with available data indicating prevention of late perforation and/or bleeding as well as accelerated tissue repair/healing.1 Apart from polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheets, another biocompatible, naturally absorbable hemostatic substance for endoscopic applications is oxidized regenerated cellulose, which is less expensive and more broadly available.2 Apart from endoscopic shielding for endoscopic resection procedures, there is an ever\\\\u2010increasing set of clinical applications in interventional endoscopy reported, including perforation and/or fistula closure, difficult\\\\u2010to\\\\u2010treat bleeding situations, and\\\\u2014among others\\\\u2014stricture prevention following esophageal ESD procedures.3, 4, 5 However, argon plasma coagulation (APC), for which endoscopic shielding has not yet been reported, is by itself considered a low\\\\u2010risk procedure in terms of bleeding in recent guidelines, however, clinical caution is mandatory in the presence of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Delayed bleeding and/or perforation after APC application, especially in the cecal pole, may occur and may have deleterious consequences in patients with recent coronary stent interventions. From such reasoning, here, the first report on preventive endoscopic shielding of an APC site in such a complex clinical setting is presented. Of note, mandatory DAPT indications are becoming more and more common in increasingly aging populations with a high comorbidity of advanced cardiovascular disease and colorectal angiodysplasia.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Haemorrhage, Perforation, Argon plasma coagulation, Antiplatelet therapy, Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Epistaxis, Drug ineffective, Extravasation blood, Blood urine, Haemoptysis, Haematochezia, Internal haemorrhage, Bloody discharge, Cerebral haemorrhage, Gingival bleeding, Menorrhagia, Blood loss anaemia, Withdrawal bleed, Post procedural haemorrhage, Off label use, Metrorrhagia, Haematoma, Spontaneous haemorrhage, Haemorrhage intracranial, Haematemesis, Anticoagulant therapy, Uterine haemorrhage, Haemorrhagic disorder, Abnormal withdrawal bleeding, Vaginal haemorrhage, Haematuria, Respiratory tract haemorrhage, Heparin neutralisation therapy, Skin haemorrhage, Corneal bleeding, Procedural haemorrhage, Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Ecchymosis, Perforated ulcer, Retinal haemorrhage, Sinus perforation, Traumatic haemorrhage, Venous haemorrhage, Hyphaema, Urogenital haemorrhage, Vascular rupture, Vessel perforation, Dysfunctional uterine bleeding, Bleeding varicose vein, Disseminated intravascular coagulation\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
