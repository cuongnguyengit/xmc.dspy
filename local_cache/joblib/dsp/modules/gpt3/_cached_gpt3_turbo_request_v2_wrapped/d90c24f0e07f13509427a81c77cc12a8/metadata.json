ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: A sulfasalazine-induced DRESS (Drug Reactivation with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms) was complicated by a Crohn\\'s-like colitis. We demonstrated HHV-6 reactivation with presence of HHV-6 DNA and small noncoding RNA in colonic lesions. This observation confirms the major role of HHV-6 reactivation in DRESS manifestations and the importance of looking for HHV-6 reactivation in DRESS. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), also referred to as drug\\\\u2010induced hypersensitivity syndrome (DIHS), is a severe hypersensitivity drug reaction associating skin eruption and organ involvement. We report a 32\\\\u2010year\\\\u2010old man with sulfasalazine\\\\u2010induced DRESS with reactivation of human herpesvirus 6B (HHV\\\\u20106B). His case is remarkable because he had chronic persistent HHV\\\\u20106 infection with colonic infection and development of Crohn\\'s disease. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe drug hypersensitivity syndrome. 1 , 2 The pathophysiology of this syndrome is not fully understood, but human herpesvirus 6 (HHV\\\\u20106) reactivation plays a major role in its development. 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 In most cases, duration of HHV\\\\u20106 reactivation is limited. We report a typical case of sulfasalazine\\\\u2010induced DRESS with reactivation of HHV\\\\u20106B in a patient with spondyloarthritis who developed a Crohn\\'s\\\\u2010like colitis after DRESS. We demonstrated a chronic persistent HHV\\\\u20106 infection with the presence of HHV\\\\u20106 DNA and encoded small noncoding RNA (sncRNA) in colonic lesions. 2 CASE REPORT A 32\\\\u2010year\\\\u2010old man was treated for axial and peripheral spondyloarthritis by sulfasalazine without any symptom suggestive of Crohn\\'s disease. He presented 3 weeks after the beginning of sulfasalazine on August 2009 with exanthema, facial edema, high fever, and diffuse lymphadenopathy. The first blood tests confirmed an eosinophilia (3200 cells/\\\\u00b5L), a mononucleosis syndrome with atypical lymphocytes and an hepatitis with a drop of prothrombin ratio to 65%. He subsequently developed pneumonitis and colitis. A diagnosis of sulfasalazine\\\\u2010induced DRESS was made, and sulfasalazine was discontinued. The patient was treated by intravenous methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulins. Intravenous corticosteroids were changed for oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/d). Visceral manifestations progressively improved. HHV\\\\u20106B viral load in whole blood was at a high level (23 495 gec/M cells). 5 , 6 , 7 Epstein\\\\u2010Barr virus and cytomegalovirus viral loads measured by PCR remained negative.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Pyrexia, Pneumonia, Pneumonitis, Colitis, Diarrhoea, Eosinophilia, Lymphadenopathy, Febrile neutropenia, Body temperature increased, Hyperpyrexia, Mononucleosis syndrome, Immunoglobulins, Tachycardia, Crohn\\'s disease, Eosinophil count increased, Enterocolitis, Cytomegalovirus infection, Prothrombin time ratio, Infectious mononucleosis, Hyperthermia, Inflammatory bowel disease, Interstitial lung disease, Allergic eosinophilia, Colitis microscopic, Human herpesvirus 6 infection, Enteritis, Prothrombin level, Pulmonary eosinophilia, Hypereosinophilic syndrome, Colitis ischaemic, Persistent generalised lymphadenopathy, Eosinophil percentage increased, Eosinophil morphology abnormal, Lung consolidation, Epstein-Barr virus infection, Gastroenteritis, Abdominal lymphadenopathy, Neutropenic colitis, Eosinophilic pneumonia, Eosinophil count abnormal, Toxicity to various agents, Cytomegalovirus mononucleosis, Organising pneumonia, Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Alveolitis, Gastrointestinal inflammation, Proctitis, Neutropenia, Eosinophil morphology, Hilar lymphadenopathy\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
