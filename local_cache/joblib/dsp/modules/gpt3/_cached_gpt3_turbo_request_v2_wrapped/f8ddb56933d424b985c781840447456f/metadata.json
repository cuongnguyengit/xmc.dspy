ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: SARS-CoV-2 late shedding may be infectious between immunocompromised hosts. ABSTRACT: Immunocompromised patients shed SARS-CoV-2 for extended periods, but to our knowledge person-to-person transmission from late shedding has not been reported. We present a case in which a COVID-19 patient infected another over 28 days after the patient\\'s initial symptoms, past current guideline recommendations of 20 days for length of isolation in immunocompromised patients. Whole genome sequencing of their viruses was performed to ascertain the transmission. Severely immunocompromised patients, whose clearance of the virus is impaired, may remain infectious for extended periods. Caution should be taken particularly in hospital settings where lapses in isolation procedures might pose increased risk, especially to other immunocompromised patients. TEXT: The world has been in the grip of a pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its associated disease (COVID-19) for over a year now. Several reports have been published showing that some patients shed the virus for prolonged periods [1\\\\u20133]. Patients receiving chemotherapy are generally severely immunosuppressed and, as such, susceptible to a wide variety of infections also with poorer outcomes. It is, therefore, not surprising that the same applies for cancer patients faced off with COVID-19 [4]. When compared to immunocompetent patients, immunocompromised patients also shed the virus for longer periods of time [1,3,5]. Nonetheless, to our knowledge no studies to date have reported cases of person-to-person transmission in this late shedding and, hence, the clinical and epidemiological significance has therefore remained unclear. However, there is evidence from other viral infections such as influenza and noroviral diarrhoea showing that severely immunocompromised patients may shed the virus and remain infectious for extended periods of time due to impaired clearance [6,7]. Current CDC [8] and ECDC [9] guidelines recommend the duration of isolation for severely immunocompromised COVID-19 patients to be up to 20 days. We present a case that infers prolonged infectiousness, even past 20 days, to be possible with immunosuppressed patients and posits it to be a matter of consequence especially in hospital settings.
