The vacancy mentions \\\\\"Fluency in English,\\\\\" which directly points to the skill \\\\\"English.\\\\\" It also mentions \\\\\"excellent communication,\\\\\" which can be related to \\\\\"communication\\\\\" and \\\\\"communication principles.\\\\\" The phrase \\\\\"collaborations skills\\\\\" suggests the skills \\\\\"work in teams,\\\\\" \\\\\"establish collaborative relations,\\\\\" and \\\\\"cooperate with colleagues.\\\\\" The vacancy also requires \\\\\"independence in paper and project writing,\\\\\" which implies the skills \\\\\"write English\\\\\" and could also suggest \\\\\"develop communications strategies\\\\\" if we interpret \\\\\"project writing\\\\\" as a form of strategic communication planning. However, this last connection is a bit of a stretch, as the vacancy does not explicitly mention strategy development.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: English, communication, communication principles, work in teams, establish collaborative relations, cooperate with colleagues, write English\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: The successful candidate will be expected to independently conduct the experimental work in this project .\\\\n\\\\nOptions: gather experimental data, perform studies and field investigation, perform laboratory investigations, laboratory-based sciences, laboratory techniques, conduct field work, perform scientific research, perform laboratory tests, use laboratory equipment, laboratory equipment, present exhibition, perform field research, perform chemical experiments, assist scientific research, apply scientific methods, conduct experiments on animals, design prototypes, formulate findings, metrology, occupational science, work independently, good laboratory practice, contact scientists, perform scientific experiments in space, make independent operating decisions, produce samples, applied zoology, test materials, analyse experimental laboratory data, research new photographic procedures, technical drawings, carry out scientific research in observatory, participant observation, medical studies, research human behaviour, use testing equipment, conduct regular aviation research, collect samples, assist in the production of laboratory documentation, disseminate results to the scientific community, prepare optical laboratory activities, evaluate research activities, test procedures, carry out geological explorations, engineering processes, metalworking, scientific research methodology, apply knowledge of science technology and engineering, archaeology, demonstrate curiosity\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed in the job vacancy snippet. The vacancy states that the candidate will \\\\\"independently conduct the experimental work,\\\\\" which suggests the skills \\\\\"work independently,\\\\\" \\\\\"conduct experiments,\\\\\" and \\\\\"perform laboratory investigations\\\\\" since experimental work is typically associated with laboratory settings. The term \\\\\"experimental work\\\\\" also implies that the candidate should be able to \\\\\"use laboratory equipment\\\\\" and \\\\\"perform scientific research.\\\\\" The vacancy does not specify the type of experiments, so we cannot assume it involves animals, space, or any specific field like zoology or archaeology. It also does not mention presenting, assisting others, formulating findings, or disseminating results, so we should not include those skills. The focus is on conducting the work independently.\\\\n\\\\nSkills:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706652533.2302456}
