ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\\\\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: Combinations of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI) are part of standard treatments for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). For these molecules, the impact of a low relative dose intensity (RDI) on survival is not sufficiently known in real-life. Data were collected retrospectively from patients treated in our center for an unresectable mCRC with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI as a first-line treatment. To study the impact on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), patients were divided into high and low RDI according to the median RDI of 5-FU on one end, and the median RDI of oxaliplatin or irinotecan (OXA-IRI) on the other. In our population of 75 patients, the median age was 67.1 years and 77% of patients were treated with FOLFIRI. Patients with high RDI for OXA-IRI had better PFS compared to patients with low RDI (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; p = 0.03). There was no statistically significant difference in PFS for patients with high RDI for 5-FU (HR, 0.66; p = 0.09). No difference was found in overall survival according to the RDI of OXA-IRI (HR, 0.72; p = 0.18) or 5-FU (HR, 0.77; p = 0.29). RDI had no significant impact on toxicities. Our analysis suggests that a low RDI of oxaliplatin and irinotecan has a negative effect on PFS. RDI had no significant effect on OS in our cohort. The clinical benefit of maintaining high RDI in these patients appears low. TEXT: Introduction In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with unresectable metastases, the combination of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX regimen) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI regimen) is part of the first-line standard treatment that improved patient survival when compared to 5-FU/LV administered alone [1\\\\u20134]. The use of monoclonal antibodies against VEGF and EGFR has also proved beneficial in this situation [5]. These treatments are intended to be administered at a certain dose and regimen. However, due to the onset of toxicities, it is common in clinical practice to make dose reductions or delay the administration of these molecules, which has the consequence of decreasing the relative dose intensity (RDI) [6, 7]. In many cancers, low chemotherapy RDI is associated with decreased disease control and survival [8\\\\u201311]. With regard to mCRC, certain retrospective analyses of patients treated with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI have highlighted a link between survival and RDI of oxaliplatin and irinotecan [12, 13]. For 5-FU, one study has shown a possible link between RDI and response rate [14]; however, these results were not confirmed in a second trial when 5-FU was combined with LV [15]. In these studies, data resulted from clinical trials. As far as is known, in real-life, no study has shown a negative impact on survival of a low RDI of oxaliplatin, irinotecan or 5-FU in patients treated with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI [16, 17].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Monoclonal antibody unconjugated therapy, Monoclonal antibody immunoconjugate therapy, Monoclonal antibody chemoimmunoconjugate therapy, EGFR gene mutation, Fibroblast growth factor 23, Insulin-like growth factor, Neutralising antibodies, EGFR status assay, Inhibiting antibodies, Vascular endothelial growth factor assay, Placenta growth factor, Blood folate, EGFR gene overexpression, Non-neutralising antibodies, Monoclonal antibody radioconjugate therapy, Vascular endothelial growth factor overexpression, Monoclonal antibody toxin conjugate therapy, Monoclonal immunoglobulin present, Human epidermal growth factor receptor increased, Anti-interferon antibody, Human epidermal growth factor receptor decreased, Folate deficiency, Angiogenesis biomarker, Blood folate decreased, Blood folate increased, Insulin-like growth factor increased, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Fibroblast growth factor 23 increased, Human epidermal growth factor receptor negative, Osteoprotegerin ligand, Anti-VGKC antibody, Beta-2 glycoprotein antibody, Monoclonal immunoglobulin increased, Blood folate abnormal, Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase deficiency, Anaemia folate deficiency, Anti-muscle specific kinase antibody, Immunosuppression, Anti-neuronal antibody, Insulin-like growth factor abnormal, Anti-insulin receptor antibody, Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, Anti-NMDA antibody, Drug specific antibody, Anti-complement antibody, Immunosuppressant drug level, Vitamin B1, Anti-erythropoietin antibody, Vitreous fibrin, Anti-epithelial antibody\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
