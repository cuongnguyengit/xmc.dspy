The vacancy mentions \\\\\"Fluency in English,\\\\\" which directly points to the skill \\\\\"English.\\\\\" It also mentions \\\\\"excellent communication,\\\\\" which can be related to \\\\\"communication\\\\\" and \\\\\"communication principles.\\\\\" The phrase \\\\\"collaborations skills\\\\\" suggests the skills \\\\\"work in teams,\\\\\" \\\\\"establish collaborative relations,\\\\\" and \\\\\"cooperate with colleagues.\\\\\" The vacancy also requires \\\\\"independence in paper and project writing,\\\\\" which implies the skills \\\\\"write English\\\\\" and could also suggest \\\\\"develop communications strategies\\\\\" if we interpret \\\\\"project writing\\\\\" as a form of strategic communication planning. However, this last connection is a bit of a stretch, as the vacancy does not explicitly mention strategy development.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: English, communication, communication principles, work in teams, establish collaborative relations, cooperate with colleagues, write English\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: You are expected to drive the development of technology within solids processing .\\\\n\\\\nOptions: provide training on technological business developments, develop technological improvement strategies, precious metal processing, non-ferrous metal processing, identify technological needs, ferrous metal processing, select material to process, Prototyping development, coordinate technological activities, lead technology development of an organisation, manufacturing processes, metal forming technologies, adapt to changes in technological development plans, monitor developments in technology used for design, computer technology, define technology strategy, apply knowledge of science technology and engineering, provide technical training, chemical processes, manufacturing of metal assembly products, types of metal manufacturing processes, materials science, jewellery processes, hardware industry, monitor technology trends, innovation processes, manufacturing of small metal parts, participate in technical aspects of the production, innovate in ICT, cut metal products, gather technical information, forging processes, Iterative development, ICT infrastructure, manufacturing of metal containers, solid-state chemistry, analyse the need for technical resources, glassworking, systems development life-cycle, metal drawing processes, chemical technologies in metal manufacture, ultra-high temperature processing, provide technical expertise, manufacture metal additive manufacturing parts, metalworking, metallurgy, fabricate metal parts, process applications, seek innovation in current practices, manufacturing of metal structures\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed in the job vacancy snippet. The vacancy states that the candidate is expected to \\\\\"drive the development of technology within solids processing.\\\\\" This directly implies the skill \\\\\"lead technology development of an organisation\\\\\" as the candidate is expected to drive development. It also suggests \\\\\"identify technological needs\\\\\" since driving development would typically involve understanding what technological advancements are necessary. The term \\\\\"solids processing\\\\\" could relate to \\\\\"precious metal processing,\\\\\" \\\\\"non-ferrous metal processing,\\\\\" and \\\\\"ferrous metal processing,\\\\\" but without more context, it\\'s not clear which specific type of solids processing is relevant, so we cannot confidently select these. The phrase \\\\\"development of technology\\\\\" also suggests \\\\\"monitor developments in technology used for design,\\\\\" \\\\\"\\\\n\\\\nSkills:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706652535.7079043}
