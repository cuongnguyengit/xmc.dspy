ABSTRACT: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon and life-threating condition characterized by major immune activation and massive cytokine production by mononuclear inflammatory cells, due to defects in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. It is even more unusual in renal transplant recipients, in which it is often associated with uncontrolled infection. The mortality is high in HLH and differential diagnosis with sepsis is a challenge. The approach and management depend on the underlying trigger and comorbidities. We report a case of a 50-year-old renal transplant female admitted with fever and malaise 3 months post-transplant and presenting anemia, fever, hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of serum ferritin, and positive CMV antigenemia. Urine was positive for decoy cells and BKV-DNA. Graft biopsy showed CMV nephritis. Both blood and urine cultures where positive for E. coli. Hemophagocytosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone, with complete response after 3 weeks. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of a rare and serious condition in a renal transplant patient, which can allow a favorable clinical course and improve survival rate. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) consists of an immune hyperactivation syndrome that takes place when NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to eliminate activated macrophages, leading to over production of proinflammatory cytokines1. There are primary and acquired causes. Primary HLH is rare and typically manifests in childhood because of two autosomal recessive defects in genes that encode proteins involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules during apoptosis in natural killer (NK) cells.1 , 2Acquired (secondary) HLH is triggered by various conditions as infections, immunodeficiency, rheumatologic diseases, and cancer.1 , 3 , 4 Infection is the most common precipitating factor of HLH in adults, mainly viruses of herpes family (EBV, CMV, HSV, HHV8), but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens can also be a trigger.5 , 6 Multiorgan involvement and organomegaly are frequently found and hemophagocytosis results in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of HLH is based on the presence of at least 5 of the following 8 criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting \\\\u2265 2 lineages of peripheral blood cells), hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, serum ferritin >500 ng/mL, low activity of NK cells, soluble CD25 > 2.400 U/mL and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes.7 Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red cells, platelets, or white cells in macrophage cytoplasm visualized in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.2 The syndrome is defined by a complex picture. However, some patients may have incipient or partial disease.1 Most diagnostic\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Neutropenia, Pancytopenia, Infection, Thrombocytopenia, Cytomegalovirus infection, Febrile neutropenia, Bone marrow failure, Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Leukopenia, Hypertriglyceridaemia, Anaemia, Cytopenia, Fungal infection, Hyperglycaemia, Apoptosis, Bacterial infection, Herpes simplex, Agranulocytosis, Sepsis, Hyperlipidaemia, Granulocytopenia, Hypercholesterolaemia, Condition aggravated, Blood triglycerides increased, Platelet count decreased, Hyper HDL cholesterolaemia, Aplastic anaemia, Herpes virus infection, Pyrexia, Cell death, Herpes simplex hepatitis, Cytomegalovirus viraemia, Familial hypertriglyceridaemia, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Cytomegalovirus infection reactivation, Immune-mediated pancytopenia, Disease progression, Familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Type III hyperlipidaemia, Acquired mixed hyperlipidaemia, Varicella, Type I hyperlipidaemia, Autoimmune pancytopenia, Type II hyperlipidaemia, Infection parasitic, Type V hyperlipidaemia, Blood cholesterol increased, Lipids increased, Type IV hyperlipidaemia, Plasmablast count decreased\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: To compare long-term efficacy and safety of immunotherapeutic strategies as maintenance to prevent disease relapses of generalized myasthenia gravis (MG) in real-world settings. This is a retrospective cohort study on generalized MG conducted in seven major neurological centers across China. Eligible participants were patients with generalized MG who were under minimal manifestation status or better. Main outcome measures were probability of patients free of relapses and causes of drug discontinuation. Among 1064 patients enrolled, the median (interquartile range) age was 50.3 (37.0-62.5) years and 641 (60.2%) were women. Disease relapse was significantly lower for rituximab (6.1%) compared with all the other monotherapies (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.06 to 0.56, P = .0030). As combination therapies, tacrolimus in combination with corticosteroids reduced risk of disease relapses compared with azathioprine with corticosteroids (HR = 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.81, P = .0077) or mycophenolate mofetil with corticosteroids (HR = 0.32, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.67, P = .0020). Otherwise, lower-dose corticosteroids or azathioprine as monotherapy significantly increased risk of disease relapses (HR = 2.78, 95% CI 1.94 to 3.99, P < .0001; HR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.42 to 3.23, P = .0003, respectively). The proportion of discontinuation was lowest in patients with rituximab (20.4%) as monotherapy and tacrolimus with corticosteroids (23.6%). Overall, combination treatment of immunosuppressants with corticosteroids had a lower rate of discontinuation compared with corresponding monotherapy (HR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.71, P < .0001). Rituximab as monotherapy and tacrolimus with corticosteroids displayed better clinical efficacy as well as drug maintenance to prevent disease relapses in patients with generalized MG. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoantibody\\\\u2010mediated autoimmune disorder against postsynaptic membrane proteins at the neuromuscular junction, including acetylcholine receptor (AChR), muscle\\\\u2010specific kinase (MuSK), and lipoprotein receptor\\\\u2010related protein 4 (LRP4). 1 The bulk of generalized MG therapy include acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for symptomatic management as well as immunotherapeutic agents to inhibit autoimmunity. Most patients with generalized MG require induction therapy with glucocorticosteroids (steroids), or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), plasma exchange (PE) for severe cases. And immunosuppressants are frequently used for maintenance. A repertoire of classical immunosuppressants, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, and tacrolimus have also been adopted. 2 , 3 Some efficacy of an anti\\\\u2010CD20 B\\\\u2010cell depleting agent, rituximab, is demonstrated by sustained clinical improvement with prolonged time to relapse and reduce the need of other immunosuppressants. 4 , 5 , 6 , 7\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Disease recurrence, Off label use, Disease progression, Product use in unapproved indication, Myasthenia gravis, Condition aggravated, Drug ineffective, Immunosuppression, Treatment failure, Myasthenia gravis crisis, Myasthenic syndrome, Immunomodulatory therapy, Immunochemotherapy, Therapy cessation, Immunoadsorption therapy, Immune enhancement therapy, Device maintenance issue, Immunoglobulin therapy, Treatment noncompliance, Myasthenia gravis neonatal, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Congenital myasthenic syndrome, Symptom recurrence, Immune disorder prophylaxis, Immunisation, Blood corticosterone, Neoplasm recurrence, Discontinued product administered, Death, Thrombocytopenia, Ocular myasthenia, Tumour vaccine therapy, Infection reactivation, Chemotherapy cytokine prophylaxis, Therapy non-responder, Adrenocortical steroid therapy, Medical device change, Prophylactic chemotherapy, Product use issue, Biotherapy, Recurrent cancer, Intravesical immunotherapy, Interleukin therapy, Rebound effect, Device end of service, Monoclonal antibody immunoconjugate therapy, Immune tolerance induction, Drug ineffective for unapproved indication, Neoplasm prophylaxis, Drug resistance\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653369.8820002}
