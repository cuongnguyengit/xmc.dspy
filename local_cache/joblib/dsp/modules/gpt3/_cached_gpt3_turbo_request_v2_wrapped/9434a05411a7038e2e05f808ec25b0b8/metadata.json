ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: This retrospective study was to compare the efficacy of intravitreal injection of ranibizumab and aflibercept for patients with pachychoroid neovasculopathy. 54 eyes were initially treated with 3 monthly loading injections of ranibizumab or aflibercept. Treatment switching from ranibizumab to aflibercept, and aflibercept to photodynamic therapy was done at 3 months in case of incomplete fluid absorption. At 3 months, the rate of complete fluid absorption was significantly higher in the aflibercept-treated group than in the ranibizumab-treated group (82.6% vs 51.6%, p = 0.018). The mean reduction of subfoveal choroidal thickness was significantly greater in the aflibercept group than in the ranibizumab group (-35 \\\\u00b5m vs -9 \\\\u00b5m, p = 0.013). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of visual improvement or decrease in central macular thickness. Complete fluid absorption was achieved after switching from ranibizumab to aflibercept in 13 of 15 eyes (86.7%). Adjunctive photodynamic therapy was required in 6 eyes. In conclusion, treatment mainly with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor effectively improved visual acuity within 12 months (from 20/56 to 20/44 at 3 months and to 20/36 at 12 months). Aflibercept was superior to ranibizumab in achieving dry macula and reducing choroidal thickness at 3 months. TEXT: Introduction The term \\\\u201cpachychoroid neovasculopathy\\\\u201d has been introduced to describe Type 1 neovascularization associated with choroidal thickening and/or dilated Haller vessels in the absence of characteristic age-related macular degeneration features1,2. It is a newly recognized clinical entity of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) that is thought to be induced by pachychoroid phenotype\\\\u2013driven pathophysiological mechanisms3. This disease entity has been suggested to be in the spectrum between central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Pang and Freund reported that pachychoroid neovasculopathy can develop after long-standing CSC and may eventually progress to PCV in some cases2.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: No adverse event, Fatigue, Neutropenia, Drug ineffective, Asthenia, Nausea, Alopecia, Sensory level normal, No reaction on previous exposure to drug, Muscle strength normal, Breath sounds absent, Decreased activity, Nothing by mouth order, Unevaluable therapy, Nocardiosis, Headache, Vital dye staining cornea absent, Nocturia, Pain threshold decreased, Decreased appetite, Pain, Malnutrition, Non-pitting oedema, Non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma unspecified histology indolent, Therapy naive, Muscular weakness, Weight decreased, Neuropathy peripheral, Hypoaesthesia, Therapy non-responder, Hypokinesia, Uncircumcised, Sensory loss, Non-scarring alopecia, Sperm concentration zero, Inadequate analgesia, Starvation, Inadequate diet, Non-dipping, Tenderness, Wound healing normal, Non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma unspecified histology indolent stage I, Discomfort, Tender joint count decreased, Hypotrichosis, Homans\\' sign negative, Nutritional condition normal, General physical health deterioration, General physical condition normal, Tender joint count\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653484.6621752}
