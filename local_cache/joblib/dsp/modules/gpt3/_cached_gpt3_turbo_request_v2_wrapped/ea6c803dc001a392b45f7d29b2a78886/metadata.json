ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \\\\\"found down\\\\\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \\\\u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \\\\u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\\\\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\\\\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \\\\u201ccatch up\\\\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Insomnia, Compartment syndrome, Crush syndrome, Somnolence, Acute kidney injury, Fatigue, Sleep disorder, Sleep deficit, Poor quality sleep, Sleep inertia, Sleep terror, Irregular sleep phase, Behavioural induced insufficient sleep syndrome, Middle insomnia, Parasomnia, Dyssomnia, Terminal insomnia, Abnormal sleep-related event, Abdominal compartment syndrome, Delayed sleep phase, Psychophysiologic insomnia, Paradoxical insomnia, Advanced sleep phase, Somnambulism, Crush injury, Sleep attacks, Sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, Hyposomnia, Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, Orbital compartment syndrome, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition insomnia type, Condition aggravated, Initial insomnia, Irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition parasomnia type, Hypersomnia, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition mixed type, Myalgia, Bedridden, Behavioural insomnia of childhood, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition hypersomnia type, Decompression sickness, Breathing-related sleep disorder, Loss of dreaming, Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Rapid eye movements sleep abnormal, Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Lethargy, Crushing injury of trunk, Sudden onset of sleep\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: This retrospective study was to compare the efficacy of intravitreal injection of ranibizumab and aflibercept for patients with pachychoroid neovasculopathy. 54 eyes were initially treated with 3 monthly loading injections of ranibizumab or aflibercept. Treatment switching from ranibizumab to aflibercept, and aflibercept to photodynamic therapy was done at 3 months in case of incomplete fluid absorption. At 3 months, the rate of complete fluid absorption was significantly higher in the aflibercept-treated group than in the ranibizumab-treated group (82.6% vs 51.6%, p = 0.018). The mean reduction of subfoveal choroidal thickness was significantly greater in the aflibercept group than in the ranibizumab group (-35 \\\\u00b5m vs -9 \\\\u00b5m, p = 0.013). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of visual improvement or decrease in central macular thickness. Complete fluid absorption was achieved after switching from ranibizumab to aflibercept in 13 of 15 eyes (86.7%). Adjunctive photodynamic therapy was required in 6 eyes. In conclusion, treatment mainly with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor effectively improved visual acuity within 12 months (from 20/56 to 20/44 at 3 months and to 20/36 at 12 months). Aflibercept was superior to ranibizumab in achieving dry macula and reducing choroidal thickness at 3 months. TEXT: Introduction The term \\\\u201cpachychoroid neovasculopathy\\\\u201d has been introduced to describe Type 1 neovascularization associated with choroidal thickening and/or dilated Haller vessels in the absence of characteristic age-related macular degeneration features1,2. It is a newly recognized clinical entity of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) that is thought to be induced by pachychoroid phenotype\\\\u2013driven pathophysiological mechanisms3. This disease entity has been suggested to be in the spectrum between central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Pang and Freund reported that pachychoroid neovasculopathy can develop after long-standing CSC and may eventually progress to PCV in some cases2.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: No adverse event, Fatigue, Neutropenia, Drug ineffective, Asthenia, Nausea, Alopecia, Sensory level normal, No reaction on previous exposure to drug, Muscle strength normal, Breath sounds absent, Decreased activity, Nothing by mouth order, Unevaluable therapy, Nocardiosis, Headache, Vital dye staining cornea absent, Nocturia, Pain threshold decreased, Decreased appetite, Pain, Malnutrition, Non-pitting oedema, Non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma unspecified histology indolent, Therapy naive, Muscular weakness, Weight decreased, Neuropathy peripheral, Hypoaesthesia, Therapy non-responder, Hypokinesia, Uncircumcised, Sensory loss, Non-scarring alopecia, Sperm concentration zero, Inadequate analgesia, Starvation, Inadequate diet, Non-dipping, Tenderness, Wound healing normal, Non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma unspecified histology indolent stage I, Discomfort, Tender joint count decreased, Hypotrichosis, Homans\\' sign negative, Nutritional condition normal, General physical health deterioration, General physical condition normal, Tender joint count\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
