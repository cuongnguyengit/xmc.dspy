ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: The need for area under the curve measurements in the field of ganciclovir therapeutic drug monitoring in children: a case report. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Ganciclovir pharmacokinetics is characterized by a high variability in drug exposure. Usually, monitoring of ganciclovir exposure is performed by measuring trough concentration. However, due to the specificity of pediatric pharmacokinetics, trough concentration measurements may not be a relevant surrogate of ganciclovir exposure. Area under the curve of concentration (AUC) may be a more appropriate biomarker. METHODS We report the case of 3.6-year-old boy with Emberger syndrome with a cytomegalovirus reactivation occurring after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. After a few days of treatment with intravenous ganciclovir, sub-therapeutic trough ganciclovir concentrations were measured (< 0.5 \\\\u00b5g/mL) and viral load still increased. Ganciclovir dosage was increased by two-fold to deal with this treatment failure. Trough concentrations remained sub-therapeutic. The patient had hematologic disorder therefore it was decided to estimate ganciclovir AUC to assess more accurately drug exposure before any further dosage modification. AUC0-12 h was measured at 51 \\\\u03bcg h/mL, which was within the therapeutic range (40-60 \\\\u03bcg h/mL). Afterward, viral load decreased and became undetectable. CONCLUSIONS This case report highlights that monitoring ganciclovir exposure based on AUC should be performed to tailor drug dosage in order to improve treatment efficacy and safety in pediatric patients. TEXT: pmcBackground Ganciclovir is the treatment of choice for Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in immunocompromised patients [1]. Its pharmacokinetics is characterized by a high interpatient variability [2, 3]. Therefore, therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of ganciclovir is valuable to individualize dosing regimens [4]. Measuring trough concentration (C0) in plasma is the standard approach as a proxy for the antiviral drug exposure. Area under the curve of concentration versus times (AUC) measurements is considered to be the best surrogate for drug exposure. However this parameters is rarely used for ganciclovir TDM in clinical practice while population pharmacokinetic modeling removed practical huddles that used to limit access to AUC-based TDM [5]. Due to the specificity of pediatric pharmacokinetics, trough concentration measurements may not be a relevant exposure biomarker for ganciclovir and AUC evaluation may be more appropriate in this context [2\\\\u20134]. Case presentation To emphasize this statement, we report the case of a 3.6-year-old boy with Emberger syndrome. This syndrome is associated with an increased risk of myelodysplastic syndrome, familial acute myeloid leukemia and immune deficiency. Therapeutic management is limited to prophylactic antimicrobial treatment and pre-emptive allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allogenic HSCT).\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Myelodysplastic syndrome, Immunodeficiency, Pancytopenia, Cytomegalovirus infection, Cytomegalovirus infection reactivation, Anaemia, Neutropenia, Bone marrow failure, Stem cell transplant, Allogenic stem cell transplantation, Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant, Antibiotic prophylaxis, Infection prophylaxis, Condition aggravated, Stem cell therapy, Humoral immune defect, Myelodysplastic syndrome transformation, Acute myeloid leukaemia, Opportunistic infection prophylaxis, Pyrexia, Myelodysplastic syndrome unclassifiable, Allogenic bone marrow transplantation therapy, Secondary immunodeficiency, Primary immunodeficiency syndrome, Immunodeficiency common variable, Stem cell donor, Autologous bone marrow transplantation therapy, Bone marrow transplant, Immunodeficiency congenital, Blood stem cell harvest, Cell-mediated immune deficiency, Prophylaxis, Epstein-Barr virus infection reactivation, Combined immunodeficiency, Off label use, Human herpesvirus 6 infection reactivation, Haematopoietic stem cell mobilisation, Anti-infective therapy, Unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation therapy, Parasitic infection prophylaxis, Refractory anaemia with an excess of blasts, Antifungal prophylaxis, Bone marrow disorder, Donor leukocyte infusion, Refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia, Panmyelopathy, Prophylaxis urinary tract infection, Cytomegalovirus viraemia, Bone marrow donor, Mismatched donor bone marrow transplantation therapy\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
