ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: Hodgkin\\'s disease is recognized as part of the spectrum of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), although it is still an uncommon de novo malignancy in this population. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been linked to both post-transplant non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphomas and Hodgkin\\'s disease. We report a case of recurrent Hodgkin\\'s disease in a patient who received a renal transplant in childhood and later developed EBV-associated Hodgkin\\'s disease with remission after chemotherapy until subsequent relapse 9 years later that was successfully treated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of recurrent Hodgkin\\'s disease in a transplant recipient. We briefly discuss the pathogenesis of and risk factors for EBV-related PTLD, utility of EBV load surveillance, and the options for treatment of PTLD including immunosuppression reduction, antiviral therapy, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, cytotoxic T cells, and the possible roles of interferon-alpha and rapamycin. TEXT: Case report The patient is a 27-year-old white man who received a living-related donor transplant from his father at 11 years of age in 1986 for end stage renal disease secondary to posterior urethral valves. The patient was seronegative for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein\\\\u2013Barr virus (EBV) prior to transplantation. His father\\'s EBV and CMV status were unavailable. The transplant course was complicated by immediate postoperative acute renal artery thrombosis, which required transplant nephrectomy. He then received a deceased donor renal transplant 10 days later. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (Sandimmune formulation), azathioprine, and prednisone. He received 12 doses of Minnesota equine antilymphocyte immunoglobulin (MALG) for induction followed by 10 doses of murine anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) for two episodes of acute graft rejection over the 7 weeks following the transplant. The deceased donor\\'s EBV and CMV status were unavailable from medical records. The patient developed acute infectious mononucleosis 2 months after transplantation demonstrated by positive EBV serology. He was treated with acyclovir and the infectious mononucleosis resolved. At the age of 18, he presented with 5 months of fever, weight-loss and night sweats, and was found to have axillary adenopathy, splenomegaly and bulky right mediastinal adenopathy. A right anterior, thoracotomy and lymph node biopsy demonstrated Hodgkin\\'s disease, nodular sclerosing subtype. Hodgkin\\'s\\\\u2013Reed\\\\u2013Sternberg (HRS) cells were strongly positive for CD30 and EBV-latent membrane protein (LMP)-1. He was staged as Hodgkin\\'s disease-IIIB. His EBV serology demonstrated elevated antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG titers and positive anti-VCA IgM, consistent with reactivation of EBV infection.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Pyrexia, Weight decreased, Decreased appetite, Splenomegaly, Weight increased, Night sweats, Febrile neutropenia, Abnormal loss of weight, Weight loss poor, Body temperature increased, Hyperpyrexia, Fatigue, Weight gain poor, Infectious mononucleosis, Lymphadenopathy, Hyperhidrosis, Cytomegalovirus infection, Body mass index decreased, Hyperthermia, Hepatosplenomegaly, Hepatomegaly, Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphoma, Underweight, Mononucleosis syndrome, Weight abnormal, Chills, Tachycardia, Body temperature abnormal, Febrile infection, Compensatory sweating, Masked fever, Epstein-Barr virus infection, Weight, Cold sweat, Hypersplenism, Body temperature decreased, Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphoproliferative disorder, Body temperature, Lymphadenopathy mediastinal, Hilar lymphadenopathy, Fat tissue decreased, Cytomegalovirus mononucleosis, Obesity, Overweight, Abnormal weight gain, Weight fluctuation, Paratracheal lymphadenopathy, Weight loss diet, Somnolence, Sweating fever\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
