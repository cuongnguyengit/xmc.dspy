ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\\\\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: Histiocytic sarcoma is a type of lymphoma that rarely involves the central nervous system (CNS). Its rarity can easily lead to a misdiagnosis. We describe a patient with primary CNS histocytic sarcoma involving the cerebral hemisphere and spinal cord, who had been initially misdiagnosed as demyelinating disease. Two biopsies were necessary before a correct diagnosis was made. A histologic examination showed bizarre shaped histiocytes with larger nuclei and nuclear atypia. The cells were positive for CD68, CD163, and S-100 protein. As a resection was not feasible due to multifocality, he was treated with highdose methotrexate, but showed no response. As a result, he was switched to high dose cytarabine; but again, showed no response. The patient died 2 months from the start of chemotherapy and 8 months from the onset of symptoms. Since few patients with this condition have been described and histopathology is difficult to diagnose, suspicion of the disease is essential. TEXT: Introduction Histiocytes are cells fully differentiated from the monocyte/ macrophage lineage and Langerhans/dendritic cells. Histiocytic and dendritic cell neoplasms are classified together by the World Health Organization, based on the cell function, rather than histogenesis. Histiocytic sarcomas are malignant proliferations of non-Langerhans histiocytes, excluding acute monocytic leukemias and associated neoplasms [1]. The pathogenesis of histiocytic sarcoma remains unclear. Furthermore, it can occur at any age, from infancy to adulthood, with several series reporting a greater predilection in males than in females. The most frequently involved organs are the skin, lymph nodes, and intestinal tract; however, it can also involve other organs. Clinical manifestations depend on the involved organs and can range from an asymptomatic single mass to systemic symptoms, including fever and weight loss. To date, only tens of cases have been reported to involve the central nervous system (CNS) (Table 1) [2-14]. These patients usually have an extremely poor prognosis. We describe here a patient with primary CNS histiocytic sarcoma, with the involvement of multiple areas within the cerebral hemisphere and spinal cord, who was initially misdiagnosed as having demyelinating disease. Case Report A 59-year-old man was presented with progressive right side weakness and numbness in the left leg for 2 months. The deep tendon reflex on his right side was hyperactive, but there was no evidence of dysarthria, dysphagia, or defecation problems. His past history includes hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease. Laboratory findings were unremarkable. Blood glucose concentration was under control, and blood pressure was maintained around 140/90 mm Hg.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Diabetes mellitus, Coronary artery disease, Blood pressure increased, Hypotension, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Arteriosclerosis coronary artery, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Labile hypertension, Malignant hypertension, Myocardial ischaemia, Hypertensive urgency, Hyperreflexia, Essential hypertension, Type 3 diabetes mellitus, Hyperglycaemia, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Angina pectoris, Acute coronary syndrome, Myocardial infarction, Hypertensive angiopathy, Orthostatic hypertension, Coronary artery insufficiency, Ischaemic cardiomyopathy, Coronary artery stenosis, Diabetes mellitus inadequate control, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Diabetic ketoacidosis, Renal hypertension, Coronary steal syndrome, Hypoglycaemia, Prehypertension, Pyrexia, Neurogenic hypertension, Secondary hypertension, Systolic hypertension, Microvascular coronary artery disease, Pancreatogenous diabetes, Ketosis-prone diabetes mellitus, Hypertensive emergency, Supine hypertension, Tachycardia, Diarrhoea, Blood pressure systolic increased, Hypertensive heart disease, Blood pressure abnormal\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653396.2086298}
