ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\\\\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\\\\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\\\\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \\\\u201cI think I\\\\u2019m having a stroke.\\\\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\\\\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Hypokalaemia, Anxiety, Hypomagnesaemia, Blood pressure increased, Hypotension, Hyponatraemia, Alcohol abuse, Hyperkalaemia, Hypocalcaemia, Alcohol use disorder, Blood potassium decreased, Alcoholism, Alcohol problem, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Drug abuse, Alcohol use, Anxiety disorder, Labile hypertension, Malignant hypertension, Hypokalaemic syndrome, Panic reaction, Alcoholic, Hypertensive urgency, Essential hypertension, Hypermagnesaemia, Nervousness, Urine potassium decreased, Alcohol poisoning, Panic disorder, Fear, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Alcoholic psychosis, Panic attack, Hypertensive angiopathy, Orthostatic hypertension, Generalised anxiety disorder, Alkalosis hypokalaemic, Electrolyte imbalance, Phobia, Alcoholic coma, Blood magnesium decreased, Idiosyncratic alcohol intoxication, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Renal hypertension, Blood alcohol, Prehypertension\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: The peritonitis caused by gram-negative organisms is a serious complication encountered in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, often causing high morbidity and mortality. There has been recognition of peritonitis caused by uncommon organisms because of improved microbiological detection techniques. The healthcare providers involved in the management of these patients should be very vigilant. We report a rare case of peritonitis caused by Citrobacter freundii. A 42-year-old male on peritoneal dialysis for five years presented with abdominal pain and cloudy effluent. The peritoneal fluid analysis was consistent with peritonitis, and peritoneal fluid culture grew Citrobacter freundii. The patient was treated with two courses of double antibiotic coverage with intraperitoneal ceftazidime and oral ciprofloxacin, which failed to resolve the infection and hence resulted in the removal the peritoneal dialysis catheter and dialysis modality change. TEXT: Introduction Gram-negative organism peritonitis is a severe complication encountered in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, often causing high morbidity and mortality. The healthcare providers involved in the care of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis should recognize that unusual organisms could cause peritonitis. We report the case of a 42-year-old male on peritoneal dialysis presenting with Citrobacter freundii peritonitis. Citrobacter freundii (C. freundii) is a motile, facultative anaerobe, non-sporing gram-negative bacilli colonize in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other animals. It is also found in water, soil, and food.1 Werkman and Gillen discovered genus Citrobacter in 1932 and the organism uses citrate a sole carbon source for the energy source and hence derives its name.2 C. freundii is hydrogen sulfide positive, indole negative, adonitol negative, and malonate negative in character.3 Peritonitis from gram-negative organisms frequently results in hospitalization, catheter loss, dialysis modality change, and mortality. These infections are hard to treat because of biofilm formation, which makes them less susceptible to antibiotics.
