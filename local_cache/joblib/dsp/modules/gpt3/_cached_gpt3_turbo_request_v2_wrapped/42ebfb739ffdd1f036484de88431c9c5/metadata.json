ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: Introduction.Staphylococcus caprae is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that has been reported in several cases as a human pathogen. However, it has rarely been reported as pathogen in native bone. Furthermore, the reported MIC levels noted in the literature for vancomycin were <2 \\\\u00b5g ml-1making vancomycin a first line choice for infected patients. Case presentation. We report a case of Staphylococcus caprae causing osteomyelitis of the lumbar spine and bacteraemia and resulting in sepsis and ultimately the demise of a patient despite appropriate prolonged antibiotic therapy. Conclusion.Staphylococcus caprae has been reported as a human pathogen since 1983 when it was discovered. We report a case involving native bone infection which is rare in the absence of mechanical hardware. Furthermore, this strain had an elevated MIC for vancomycin which has not been reported in the literature.

Introduction Staphylococcus caprae is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that was first described in 1983 after being isolated from goats where it causes mastitis [1\\\\u20134]. S. caprae typically colonizes human skin, nose and nails and since 1983 it has been reported in several cases as a human pathogen causing peritonitis, meningitis, urinary tract infections, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, prosthetic joint infections, recurrent sepsis, bacteraemia and osteomyelitis [4\\\\u20139]. Many risk factors for S. caprae have begun to emerge and include immunosuppression, diabetes, chronic renal failure, obesity, open or traumatic fractures and contact with sheep or goats [4, 6]. Importantly, several strains of S. caprae have been noted to produce toxic shock syndrome toxin and carry the gene mecA important for methicillin resistance, and have been noted to form a biofilm in vitro on prostheses or bone thought to be due to the presence of the gene altC in combination with the ica operon [1, 4, 6, 10]. Very few cases of S. caprae bone and joint infection occur in native bone and joints without prostheses, and there are few cases of bacteraemia not associated with line infections. In this case report we present Staphylococcus caprae infection of native vertebrae with resulting bacteraemia and ultimately failure of therapy, and summarize the current case reports of infection with this organism.
