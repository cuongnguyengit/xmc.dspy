ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is primarily caused by antibody-mediated destruction of platelets. Alterations in immune homeostasis can induce loss of peripheral tolerance and promote the development of self-reactive antibodies. Primary ITP is the diagnosis of exclusion made after the extensive work-up rules out other possible causes of thrombocytopenia. The association between the ITP and other autoimmune disorders is well-established. In recent years, increasing attention has been directed toward the association between celiac disease (CD) and ITP. CASE REPORT A 27-year-old man with a history of primary ITP presented with an occasional nosebleed, 1 episode of rectal bleeding, and easy bruising. The patient was later found to have high titers of TTG-IGA and endomysial IGA levels consistent with CD. Our patient not only failed to improve with the gluten-free diet, but also failed multiple lines of treatment including steroids, IVIG, rituximab, eltrombopag, and even a non-traditional treatment for ITP (azathioprine and plasma exchange). The patient\\'s CD-related antibody titers remained elevated. CONCLUSIONS It is possible that in certain cases the alteration of immune response caused by CD with a concurrent elevation of CD-related antibodies can make ITP refractory to all medical management. Whether or not this refractoriness to treatment is related to the persistently elevated antibody titers of CD or unknown genetic relationship between ITP and CD remains not entirely clear and warrants further molecular, immunologic, and genetic analysis. TEXT: pmcBackground Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an incompletely understood disease, likely related to antibody-mediated destruction of platelets (typically through IgG-antibodies directed against GpIIb/IIIa on the platelet membrane). Other mechanisms are likely to be important, including autoreactive Tc cells, as well as humoral and cellular autoimmunity directed at megakaryocytes, causing impaired platelet production. Alterations in immune homeostasis might induce loss of peripheral tolerance and promote the development of self-reactive antibodies [1]. The association between the ITP and other autoimmune disorders (including systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome) is well-established. In recent years, increasing attention has been directed toward the association between ITP and celiac disease (CD) [2].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Thrombocytopenia, Gluten free diet, Immune thrombocytopenia, Thrombocytopenic purpura, Wheat-free diet, Plasmapheresis, Steroid activity, Exchange blood transfusion, Purpura non-thrombocytopenic, Apheresis, Low carbohydrate diet, Kosher diet, Plateletpheresis, Purpura, Leukopenia, Transfusion, Steroid therapy, Autoimmune heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Platelet count decreased, Thrombocytosis, Anti-platelet antibody, Palpable purpura, High carbohydrate diet, Unhealthy diet, Platelet destruction increased, Blood volume expansion, Spontaneous heparin-induced thrombocytopenia syndrome, Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, Ketogenic diet, Diabetic diet, Extracorporeal circulation, Vascular purpura, Erythrocytapheresis, Haemoperfusion, Immune-mediated dermatitis, Weight loss diet, Non-immune heparin associated thrombocytopenia, Neonatal exchange blood transfusion, Anti-platelet antibody positive, High fat diet, Purpura senile, Autotransfusion, Platelet transfusion, Diet refusal, Immune-mediated pancytopenia, Blood product transfusion dependent, Intravascular haemolysis, Cows milk free diet, Haemodilution\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
