ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: To determine intraocular pressure (IOP) changes after intravitreal bevacizumab or ranibizumab injection administered for various retinal disorders. A retrospective chart review of 796 eyes of 574 patients receiving intravitreal ranibizumab (0.5 mg) and/or bevacizumab (1.25 mg) injection for different retinal diseases from March 2009 to December 2016 was performed. Ocular hypertension (OHT) was defined as IOP >21 mmHg or an increase in IOP of >5 mmHg from the baseline. IOP at the baseline and at various time periods after the injection was evaluated in the injected eyes and fellow control eyes. One hundred and thirty-one eyes received either a single dose of bevacizumab or ranibizumab intravitreal injection unilaterally, 222 patients received single injection in both the eyes (n = 444 eyes), and 221 eyes received multiple doses of the injection. OHT was noted in 11 eyes (1.38%), of which 3 eyes (0.38%) had transient OHT and 8 eyes (1%) had delayed and sustained OHT and among them, 3 eyes (0.4%) progressed to glaucoma. Preinjection IOP was significantly higher in the treated eyes when compared to the control untreated eyes (P = 0.006). Incidence of delayed and sustained OHT is low after a single or multiple intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab injections. Clinicians should be aware of possibility of OHT or glaucoma after the procedure. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents is the mainstay for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization, secondary to the neovascular age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) or pathological myopia, macular edema secondary to the retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and diabetic retinopathy (DR).1234 Commonly used intravitreal VEGF-antagonists are ranibizumab (Lucentis; Genentech/Novartis, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) and bevacizumab (Avastin; Genentech/Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., CA, USA).\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Glaucoma, Ocular hypertension, Hypertension, Intraocular pressure increased, Open angle glaucoma, Angle closure glaucoma, Uveitic glaucoma, Borderline glaucoma, Ocular hyperaemia, Exfoliation glaucoma, Blood pressure increased, Malignant glaucoma, Normal tension glaucoma, Pseudophakic glaucoma, Pigmentary glaucoma, Developmental glaucoma, Aphakic glaucoma, Phacolytic glaucoma, Hypotension, Diabetic glaucoma, Glaucomatous optic disc atrophy, Eye pain, Glaucoma traumatic, Mean arterial pressure increased, Anterior chamber degeneration, Blood pressure systolic increased, Retinopathy hypertensive, Hypertensive urgency, Narrow anterior chamber angle, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Cataract, Anterior chamber flare, Episcleral hyperaemia, Anterior chamber angle neovascularisation, Deep anterior chamber of the eye, Glaucomatocyclitic crises, Systolic hypertension, Blood pressure diastolic increased, Conjunctival hyperaemia, Accelerated hypertension, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Intraocular pressure fluctuation, Intraocular pressure decreased, Lagophthalmos, Eye degenerative disorder, Sympathetic ophthalmia, White coat hypertension, Diastolic hypertension, Iridodonesis, Hyperaesthesia eye\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

The article discusses intraocular pressure (IOP) changes after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab or ranibizumab. It defines ocular hypertension (OHT) and mentions that some eyes experienced transient OHT, while others had delayed and sustained OHT, with a few progressing to glaucoma.
