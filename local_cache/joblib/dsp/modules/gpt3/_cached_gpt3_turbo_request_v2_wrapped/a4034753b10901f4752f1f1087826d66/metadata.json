ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Intranasal lidocaine atomization as novel and noninvasive treatment option for postdural puncture headache : Two case reports from obstetric anesthesiology. ABSTRACT: Postdural puncture headache (PDPH) occurs in up to 11% of patients after spinal anesthesia and in more than 80% after dural perforation upon epidural anesthesia. It represents a severe anesthesiological complication in obstetric patients. If conservative medication measures do not result in a timely relief of symptoms, the current guidelines recommend the early implementation of an epidural blood patch; however, although performing an epidural blood patch is effective to treat PDPH, potential side effects include neurological complications, spinal hematoma and infections. Assumed to reduce cerebral vasodilatation as a potential pathophysiological driver of PDPH, the transnasal block of the sphenopalatine ganglion with local anesthetics is discussed as an alternative approach. In this case study a modification of this technique is reported using a mucosal atomization device (MAD) for off-label nasal administration of lidocaine in two obstetric patients suffering from PDPH. Up to now there is no experience with this modified technique in obstetric anesthesiology. The first patient (25-year-old secundigravida, body mass index [BMI] 54.7 kg/m2) displayed a pronounced PDPH with nausea and vomiting during the first day after a cesarean section under spinal anesthesia (3 attempts). The second patient (32-year-old tertiagravida, BMI 27.3 kg/m2) was readmitted to hospital due to PDPH 4 days after a natural birth under epidural anesthesia. Whereas conservative measures and therapeutic attempts with nonopioid analgesics and caffeine did not result in a sufficient treatment success, intranasal lidocaine administration via a MAD led to an immediate and persisting symptom relief. Both patients could be discharged from hospital after 24 h of surveillance and did not report any relevant side effects of the lidocaine administration. The described noninvasive and simple procedure represents a valuable addition to previously known treatment options for PDPH and a potential alternative to an epidural blood patch in obstetric patients with PDPH. Prospective studies are needed to validate the findings.
