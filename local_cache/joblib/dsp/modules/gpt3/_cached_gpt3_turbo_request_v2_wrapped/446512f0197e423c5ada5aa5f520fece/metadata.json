ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Incidence of NUT carcinoma in Western Australia from 1989 to 2014: a review of pediatric and adolescent cases from Perth Children\\'s Hospital. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND NUT carcinoma (NC), previously known as NUT midline carcinoma, is a rare and very aggressive cancer that occurs in both children and adults. NC is largely chemoresistant, with an overall survival of less than 7 months. Because the carcinoma is not restricted to a particular organ, diagnosis is often a challenge. In the absence of a clearly determined incidence for NC, we sought to study the diagnosis of patients in a well-defined population. METHODS We systematically reviewed records of all patients that presented to the Oncology Department of the Princess Margaret Hospital for Children from 1989 to 2014. This institution in the geographically isolated state of Western Australia has a catchment population of around 2 million. We then identified all high grade undifferentiated sarcomas or carcinomas in the 0-16 year age group. RESULTS Over 26 years, we found 14 patients of 16 years or younger with undifferentiated malignant tumors. Of these, five tumors were positive by immunohistochemistry for the NUT/NUTM1 (Nuclear Protein in Testis) protein and/or the translocation t(15;19). Three patients presented with thoracic tumors, one with a para-spinal tumor, and one had an upper airway nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In all five cases, there was an initial response to therapy and then progression. This 26-year survey was conducted in a geographically isolated state with a well-defined population, and we determined an estimated incidence of NC of around 0.41 per million child years (0-16 yrs. of age) at risk. From three patients it was feasible to derive cell lines for further genetic analyses and drug screening. CONCLUSIONS For the first time, the incidence of NC could be determined in a well-defined geographic area. The calculated rate of NC incidence is consistent with a history of under-recognition for this malignancy. These findings indicate that improved diagnostic detection of NC would enable better management and counselling of patients. Our findings emphasize the heterogeneity of NC, and they highlight the need to develop personalised therapy options, and to consider a diagnosis of NC in undifferentiated malignant tumors.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses NUT carcinoma (NC), a rare and aggressive cancer that occurs in both children and adults. It is mentioned that NC is largely chemoresistant, which implies that drug therapy, specifically chemotherapy, is ineffective. The article also mentions that there was an initial response to therapy and then progression, which could be interpreted as treatment failure. However, the article does not provide specific details about the types of therapy used or the specific adverse reactions to those therapies. Therefore, we can only infer that drug therapy was used and that it was ultimately ineffective.\\\\n\\\\nReactions:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653903.702747}
