ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \\\\\"found down\\\\\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \\\\u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \\\\u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\\\\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\\\\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \\\\u201ccatch up\\\\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Insomnia, Compartment syndrome, Crush syndrome, Somnolence, Acute kidney injury, Fatigue, Sleep disorder, Sleep deficit, Poor quality sleep, Sleep inertia, Sleep terror, Irregular sleep phase, Behavioural induced insufficient sleep syndrome, Middle insomnia, Parasomnia, Dyssomnia, Terminal insomnia, Abnormal sleep-related event, Abdominal compartment syndrome, Delayed sleep phase, Psychophysiologic insomnia, Paradoxical insomnia, Advanced sleep phase, Somnambulism, Crush injury, Sleep attacks, Sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, Hyposomnia, Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, Orbital compartment syndrome, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition insomnia type, Condition aggravated, Initial insomnia, Irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition parasomnia type, Hypersomnia, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition mixed type, Myalgia, Bedridden, Behavioural insomnia of childhood, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition hypersomnia type, Decompression sickness, Breathing-related sleep disorder, Loss of dreaming, Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Rapid eye movements sleep abnormal, Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Lethargy, Crushing injury of trunk, Sudden onset of sleep\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: To report a rare case of primary orbital natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma without nasal lesions but with cerebrospinal fluid involvement. A 73-year-old woman was referred to the uveitis clinic with suspected unilateral acute uveitis in her right eye and a right orbital tumor. Epstein-Barr virus DNA was detected in the aqueous humor in her right eye, and orbital biopsy revealed the presence of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal type. Positron emission tomography showed significant 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the right orbit, with no other signs of systemic involvement. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrated lymphoma cell infiltration. She was diagnosed with stage IV ENKTL and treated with orbital radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy, with subsequent remission. However, the lymphoma relapsed in her left vitreous at 10 months after therapy, suggesting metastasis of lymphoma cells to the contralateral eye via the vitreous and cerebrospinal fluid. A few cases of ocular-tissue ENKTL have been reported, mostly involving invasion or dissemination of primary nasal lesions; in contrast, primary orbital and intraocular ENKTL has rarely been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a primary orbital ENKTL metastasizing to the vitreous of the contralateral eye. Although ENKTL is rare in the orbit and intraocular tissues, it should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis in patients with orbital tumors or intraocular inflammation resistant to steroid therapy because ENKTL has a very poor prognosis in the advanced stage. TEXT: 1 Introduction Lymphomas are the most common type of primary orbital malignant tumors. Most orbital lymphomas are non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphomas, such as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, which have a relatively good prognosis, while T-cell and natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphomas are extremely rare.1,2 Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal type, formerly known as lethal midline granuloma, angiocentric T-cell lymphoma, or polymorphic reticulosis, is an uncommon disease that typically arises from the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.2,3 While most NK/T-cell lymphomas in ocular tissues occur as an invasion or dissemination of nasal ENKTL, a few cases of primary orbital or intraocular ENKTL have been reported.3,4 Here we report an extremely rare case of primary orbital NKTCL that metastasized to the contralateral eye during the follow-up period, presumably via the vitreous and cerebrospinal fluid. 2 Case report\\\\n\\\\nOptions: No adverse event, Fatigue, Neutropenia, Drug ineffective, Asthenia, Nausea, Alopecia, Sensory level normal, No reaction on previous exposure to drug, Muscle strength normal, Breath sounds absent, Decreased activity, Nothing by mouth order, Unevaluable therapy, Nocardiosis, Headache, Vital dye staining cornea absent, Nocturia, Pain threshold decreased, Decreased appetite, Pain, Malnutrition, Non-pitting oedema, Non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma unspecified histology indolent, Therapy naive, Muscular weakness, Weight decreased, Neuropathy peripheral, Hypoaesthesia, Therapy non-responder, Hypokinesia, Uncircumcised, Sensory loss, Non-scarring alopecia, Sperm concentration zero, Inadequate analgesia, Starvation, Inadequate diet, Non-dipping, Tenderness, Wound healing normal, Non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma unspecified histology indolent stage I, Discomfort, Tender joint count decreased, Hypotrichosis, Homans\\' sign negative, Nutritional condition normal, General physical health deterioration, General physical condition normal, Tender joint count\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653523.8750505}
