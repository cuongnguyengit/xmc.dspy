ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: To report a rare case of primary orbital natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma without nasal lesions but with cerebrospinal fluid involvement. A 73-year-old woman was referred to the uveitis clinic with suspected unilateral acute uveitis in her right eye and a right orbital tumor. Epstein-Barr virus DNA was detected in the aqueous humor in her right eye, and orbital biopsy revealed the presence of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal type. Positron emission tomography showed significant 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the right orbit, with no other signs of systemic involvement. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrated lymphoma cell infiltration. She was diagnosed with stage IV ENKTL and treated with orbital radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy, with subsequent remission. However, the lymphoma relapsed in her left vitreous at 10 months after therapy, suggesting metastasis of lymphoma cells to the contralateral eye via the vitreous and cerebrospinal fluid. A few cases of ocular-tissue ENKTL have been reported, mostly involving invasion or dissemination of primary nasal lesions; in contrast, primary orbital and intraocular ENKTL has rarely been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a primary orbital ENKTL metastasizing to the vitreous of the contralateral eye. Although ENKTL is rare in the orbit and intraocular tissues, it should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis in patients with orbital tumors or intraocular inflammation resistant to steroid therapy because ENKTL has a very poor prognosis in the advanced stage. TEXT: 1 Introduction Lymphomas are the most common type of primary orbital malignant tumors. Most orbital lymphomas are non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphomas, such as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, which have a relatively good prognosis, while T-cell and natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphomas are extremely rare.1,2 Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal type, formerly known as lethal midline granuloma, angiocentric T-cell lymphoma, or polymorphic reticulosis, is an uncommon disease that typically arises from the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.2,3 While most NK/T-cell lymphomas in ocular tissues occur as an invasion or dissemination of nasal ENKTL, a few cases of primary orbital or intraocular ENKTL have been reported.3,4 Here we report an extremely rare case of primary orbital NKTCL that metastasized to the contralateral eye during the follow-up period, presumably via the vitreous and cerebrospinal fluid. 2 Case report\\\\n\\\\nOptions: No adverse event, Fatigue, Neutropenia, Drug ineffective, Asthenia, Nausea, Alopecia, Sensory level normal, No reaction on previous exposure to drug, Muscle strength normal, Breath sounds absent, Decreased activity, Nothing by mouth order, Unevaluable therapy, Nocardiosis, Headache, Vital dye staining cornea absent, Nocturia, Pain threshold decreased, Decreased appetite, Pain, Malnutrition, Non-pitting oedema, Non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma unspecified histology indolent, Therapy naive, Muscular weakness, Weight decreased, Neuropathy peripheral, Hypoaesthesia, Therapy non-responder, Hypokinesia, Uncircumcised, Sensory loss, Non-scarring alopecia, Sperm concentration zero, Inadequate analgesia, Starvation, Inadequate diet, Non-dipping, Tenderness, Wound healing normal, Non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma unspecified histology indolent stage I, Discomfort, Tender joint count decreased, Hypotrichosis, Homans\\' sign negative, Nutritional condition normal, General physical health deterioration, General physical condition normal, Tender joint count\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653492.827407}
