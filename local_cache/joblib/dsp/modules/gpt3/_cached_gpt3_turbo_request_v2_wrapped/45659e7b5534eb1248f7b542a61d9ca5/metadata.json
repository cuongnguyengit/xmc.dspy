ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Some severe life-threatening conditions could be misdiagnosed during the current COVID-19 pandemic. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION COVID\\\\u201019 is a worldwide crisis with a great impact in health structures. Delay in the management of routine medical conditions has been reported during this pandemic. We describe the case of a spontaneous dissection of two coronary arteries which has been initially misclassified as a case of COVID\\\\u201019 infection and managed lately. Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and sudden death. It is defined as a separation within the coronary artery wall secondary to intramural hemorrhage, with or without tearing of the intima, thus modifying arterial architecture with the creation of a true and false channels. The starting point is often an intimal breach or even a hemorrhage of the vasa vasorum.1 SCAD preferentially affects the young population with almost no traditional cardiovascular risk factors and especially female with a sex ratio M/F of 1/5.2 It is responsible for 0.1%\\\\u20130.4% of all acute coronary syndromes.3 It is an important cause of ACS in women and represents approximately 25% of acute coronary syndromes in women under 50 years old.4 It has the same clinical presentation as acute coronary syndromes secondary to plaque ruptures. Many triggering factors are mentioned in the occurrence of a SCAD including physical or emotional stress.5 Currently, the whole world experiences a very stressful condition generated by COVID\\\\u201019 pandemic. Since the beginning of this pandemic, healthcare facilities precisely emergency room are overcrowded. So, with that massive influx of patients, many other diseases are misdiagnosed.6 Xiang et al. in their study analyzing the management and outcomes of patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction during the COVID\\\\u201019 pandemic in China found an important decrease of the hospitalized patient with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction still the outbreak of COVID\\\\u201019 pandemic. Also, they found a delay in management that patients according to the reperfusion strategy.6 Similarly, Rashid et al. found a decline of acute myocardial infarction\\\\u2010related hospitalization associated with a raise in the number of cases of out\\\\u2010of\\\\u2010hospital cardiac arrest since the beginning of this pandemic, particularly after the implementation of social confinement measures during the COVID\\\\u201019 outbreak in England. Consequently, the reorganization of hospital services and medical staff in response to COVID\\\\u201019 outbreak affected routine management of other diseases.7 Through this case, we wanted to show the harmful influence of the current pandemic in the management of potential life\\\\u2010threatening issue as SCAD. 2 CASE PRESENTATION\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Myocardial infarction, COVID-19, Acute myocardial infarction, Acute coronary syndrome, Hospitalisation, Coronary artery dissection, Asymptomatic COVID-19, Drug ineffective, Prinzmetal angina, COVID-19 pneumonia, Product use in unapproved indication, Coronary artery disease, Angina pectoris, COVID-19 treatment, COVID-19 immunisation, Silent myocardial infarction, Myocardial necrosis, Acute cardiac event, Angina unstable, Coronary steal syndrome, Cerebral infarction, Papillary muscle infarction, Transient ischaemic attack, Myocardial ischaemia, Death, Infarction, Social stay hospitalisation, Coronary artery insufficiency, Suspected COVID-19, Drug ineffective for unapproved indication, Coronary artery occlusion, Ischaemic stroke, Post procedural myocardial infarction, Stress cardiomyopathy, Off label use, Arteriosclerosis coronary artery, Coronary artery thrombosis, Arteriospasm coronary, Treatment noncompliance, Intensive care, Postinfarction angina, COVID-19 prophylaxis, Coronavirus infection, Cytomegalovirus infection, Coronary artery restenosis, Intracardiac thrombus, Periprocedural myocardial infarction, Chest pain, Treatment failure, Cardiac ventricular thrombosis\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
