ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Ibrutinib represents extraordinary progress in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, treatment-related adverse events limit the benefit of this agent. This observational, multicenter study focused on the incidence, risk factors, and prognostic impact of infections in 494 patients with CLL treated with an ibrutinib-based treatment. Ibrutinib was given to 89 (18%) previously untreated patients (combined with rituximab, 24) and 405 (82%) relapsed/refractory patients. Pneumonia (PN), grade \\\\u22653 non-opportunistic infections (NOI), and opportunistic infections (OI) were recorded in 32% of patients with an overall incidence rate per 100 person-year of 15.3% (PN, 10%; NOI, 3.3%; OI, 2%). Infections were the reason for the permanent discontinuation of ibrutinib in 9% of patients. Patients who experienced pneumonia or a severe infection showed a significantly inferior survival than those who were infection-free (p < 0.0001). A scoring system based on the three factors associated with a significant and independent impact on infections-PN or severe infection in the year before starting ibrutinib, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, \\\\u22652 prior treatments-identified patients with a two- to threefold increase in the rate of infections. In conclusion, the results of this study highlight the adverse impact of infectious events on the outcomes of CLL patients treated with ibrutinib. TEXT: 1. Introduction Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in the adult population. According to the National Cancer Institute\\\\u2019s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) [1], the estimated number of new cases of CLL in the United States in 2021 is 21,250. The incidence rapidly increases with increasing age, and the median age at diagnosis is about 70. The CLL-IPI combines genetic, biochemical, and clinical parameters into a prognostic model, discriminating four prognostic subgroups with 5-year survival probabilities ranging from 93% to 23% [2]. Several randomized trials have demonstrated the superiority of the B-cell receptor pathway inhibitor ibrutinib over chemotherapy in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). [3,4,5,6]. The remarkable activity and the favorable tolerability profile have favored the widespread use of ibrutinib for the upfront treatment of patients with CLL. However, treatment discontinuation due to specific off-target toxicities of this agent, such as bleeding events and atrial fibrillation, is not negligible, although some treatment-related adverse events are now better managed [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Pneumonia, Atrial fibrillation, Haemorrhage, Pneumonitis, Opportunistic infection, Sepsis, Lung consolidation, Organising pneumonia, Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Infection, Atrial flutter, Extravasation blood, Thrombocytopenia, Pneumonia bacterial, Epistaxis, Cardiac fibrillation, Haemorrhagic disorder, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, Internal haemorrhage, Parasitic pneumonia, Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, Disseminated intravascular coagulation, Interstitial lung disease, Ventricular fibrillation, Spontaneous haemorrhage, Supraventricular tachycardia, Pneumonia viral, Haemoptysis, Coagulopathy, Candida infection, Blood urine, Pneumonia fungal, Pneumonia aspiration, Supraventricular tachyarrhythmia, Lower respiratory tract infection, Atrial tachycardia, Arrhythmia supraventricular, Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, Lower respiratory tract inflammation, Eosinophilic pneumonia, Cerebral haemorrhage, Haematoma, Atypical pneumonia, Haematochezia, Vessel perforation, Post procedural haemorrhage, Post procedural pneumonia, Pneumonia measles, Pneumonia influenzal, Lung infiltration\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
