ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy following Herpes Zoster Ophthalmicus and Steroid-Related Intraocular Pressure Spike. ABSTRACT: A 61-year-old woman presented with sudden vision loss from a left anterior optic neuropathy in the context of severely elevated intraocular pressure after starting topical steroids for anterior uveitis related to herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). The strong temporal relationship between the vision loss and elevated IOP suggested the vision loss was related to nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). Anterior chamber paracentesis did not detect varicella zoster virus (VZV) and magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits was normal. Her vision remained stable and the optic disc edema resolved within 3 months. The occurrence of NAION following an acute elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) is well-documented in the context of surgical procedures, glaucoma, uveitis and trauma. This case indicates that not every optic neuropathy in close temporal relationship with HZO is directly attributable to the virus. NAION may also occur after steroid-related IOP spikes and ophthalmologists should ensure that patients on topical steroids are closely monitored for ocular complications. TEXT: Introduction Vision loss is a rare complication of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) and can be a result of anterior segment of posterior segment involvement. Optic neuropathy is a rare complication of HZO seen in less than 0.5% of cases and can be anterior (associated with optic disc edema) or retrobulbar [1]. The diagnosis of herpes zoster optic neuropathy (HZON) is diagnosed in patients who develop an optic neuropathy in close temporal relationship with HZO with other causes of optic neuropathy being excluded. Supportive evidence for the diagnosis is helpful by means of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with contrast demonstrating enhancement of the optic nerve in retrobulbar cases, or the detection of varicella zoster virus (VZV) in the aqueous humor or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [1]. However, the yield of detection of VZV in the CSF is low, especially in anterior cases. Treatment consists of oral or intravenous antivirals and the use of systemic corticosteroids remains controversial [1]. Patients with HZO may develop an anterior optic neuropathy that is not directly related to VZV, but secondarily related to HZO by means of other ocular complications. We report a case of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) related to HZO, which was likely secondary to the development of a steroid response and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) for the treatment of anterior uveitis. This indicates that not every optic neuropathy in close temporal relationship to HZO is directly related to the virus.
