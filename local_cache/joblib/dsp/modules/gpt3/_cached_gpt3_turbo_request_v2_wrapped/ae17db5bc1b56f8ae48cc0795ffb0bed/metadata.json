TEXT: 1 Introduction Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare neoplasm that mostly affects young women. Patients are usually diagnosed in their second or third decade of life, with a peak age between age 18 and 39 years (Young et al., 1994). The symptoms are usually nonspecific and include abdominal discomfort, pain or distension related to an abdominal or pelvic mass. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Regardless of disease stage, most patients relapse and die of disease. The estimated overall survival rate is 50% at one year and less than 10% at five years (Young et al., 1994). Several studies have reported familial cases of SCCOHT with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. It is associated with germline or somatic mutation in the SMARCA4 gene, which encodes the BRG1 protein. A recent study showed that even in patients with no family history of SCCOHT, up to half of those tested were found to carry a germline mutation (Witkowski, 2016). There is currently no standard protocol for treatment of SCCOHT and management remains a challenge. Previous studies have reported favorable results with a chemotherapy regimen consisting of vinblastine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, adriamycin and etoposide (VPCBAE) as an adjuvant treatment after surgery (Senekjian et al., 1989, Callegaro-Filho et al., 2016). Other treatments showing activity in SCCOHT include other platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. Given the young age at diagnosis, many women with this disease desire preservation of fertility. There are limited data on fertility and pregnancy outcomes among women treated for SCCOHT. In this report, we present the case of a successful pregnancy following chemotherapy with VPCBAE. 2 Case presentation\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Chemotherapy, Immunosuppression, Radiotherapy, Brachytherapy, Immunomodulatory therapy, Immunochemotherapy, Gamma radiation therapy, Drug ineffective, Photon radiation therapy, Radiosensitisation therapy, Chemotherapy single agent systemic, Immunoadsorption therapy, Prophylactic chemotherapy, Immune enhancement therapy, Chemotherapy multiple agents systemic, Regional chemotherapy, Immunoglobulin therapy, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Radiation castration, Chemotherapy side effect prophylaxis, Radioembolisation, Chemotherapy toxicity attenuation, Radiocastration procedure, Immune disorder prophylaxis, Chemotherapy extravasation management, Immunisation, Brachytherapy to soft tissue, Drug therapy, Drug interaction, Radiotherapy to head and neck, Tumour vaccine therapy, Radiation injury, Chemotherapy cytokine prophylaxis, Brachytherapy to skin, Neoplasm prophylaxis, Treatment failure, Brachytherapy to blood, Radiotherapy to soft tissue, Brachytherapy to ear nose or throat, Neoadjuvant therapy, Biotherapy, Intravesical immunotherapy, Radiotherapy to gastrointestinal tract, Interleukin therapy, Radioactive iodine therapy, Radiotherapy toxicity attenuation, Targeted cancer therapy, Monoclonal antibody immunoconjugate therapy, Immune tolerance induction, Electron radiation therapy\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
