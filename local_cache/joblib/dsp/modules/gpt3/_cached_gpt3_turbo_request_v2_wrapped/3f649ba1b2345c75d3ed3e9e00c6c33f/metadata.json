ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\\\\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: We report a case of rhabdomyolysis and severe acute kidney injury (AKI) requiring dialysis in a 69-year-old male who was recently started on sitagliptin while on chronic simvastatin therapy. This potential interaction is not included in the package insert for sitagliptin. A comprehensive literature review revealed six previous reports of rhabdomyolysis due to drug interaction between sitagliptin and statins including simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin. Of these six cases, only two had developed rhabdomyolysis-associated AKI, none of which were severe enough to require dialysis. As patients are commonly prescribed statins and sitagliptin for treatment of dyslipidemia and diabetes, health care professionals should be aware of this potential drug interaction and closely monitor their patients for signs and symptoms of rhabdomyolysis and AKI. This case highlights the importance of conducting further studies on the risk of muscular toxicity of sitagliptin especially when administered concurrently with statins. TEXT: 1. Introduction Sitagliptin belongs to a class of oral antihyperglycemic drugs known as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors [1]. Statin use for management of dyslipidemia is common in patients with diabetes. We present a patient on long-term simvastatin therapy who developed severe rhabdomyolysis and AKI soon after starting treatment with sitagliptin. 2. Case Presentation A 69-year-old white male with history of hypertension, noninsulin-dependent diabetes, chronic kidney disease stage 3, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and congestive heart failure was brought to hospital with complaints of generalized malaise, muscle weakness with pain in both his lower extremities, and inability to ambulate for last 4-5 days. He had developed these symptoms within 2 days of starting sitagliptin (Januvia 100 mg) therapy. His other medications included simvastatin, amlodipine, carvedilol, clopidogrel, gabapentin, glipizide, hydrochlorothiazide, metformin, quinapril, and ezetimibe. He gave history of similar weakness when he was started on sitagliptin therapy few months ago, so he discontinued it by himself. His primary care physician however restarted it again at recent follow-up, when the patient refused insulin therapy.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Pain, Rhabdomyolysis, Muscular weakness, Fatigue, Cardiac failure, Malaise, Headache, Cardiac failure congestive, Coronary artery disease, Asthenia, Condition aggravated, Abdominal pain, Hyperlipidaemia, Dyslipidaemia, Hypertriglyceridaemia, Hypercholesterolaemia, General physical health deterioration, Congestive cardiomyopathy, Arteriosclerosis coronary artery, Hypo HDL cholesterolaemia, Nausea, Tenderness, Cardiac failure acute, Cardiac failure high output, Hypolipidaemia, Gait disturbance, Hyper HDL cholesterolaemia, Cardiac failure chronic, Hyperglycaemia, Diabetic dyslipidaemia, Myocardial ischaemia, Lipids decreased, Dyspnoea, Acute kidney injury, Lipoprotein deficiency, Arthralgia, Acquired mixed hyperlipidaemia, Lipids increased, Blood cholesterol increased, Ventricular failure, High density lipoprotein decreased, Right ventricular failure, Hypotriglyceridaemia, Angina pectoris, Acute coronary syndrome, Remnant hyperlipidaemia, Myocardial infarction, Low density lipoprotein decreased, Lipoprotein increased, Blood triglycerides increased\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653397.7826087}
