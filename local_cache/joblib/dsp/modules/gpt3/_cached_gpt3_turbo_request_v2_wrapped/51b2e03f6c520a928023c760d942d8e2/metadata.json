ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: EBV-associated recurrent Hodgkin\\'s disease after renal transplantation. ABSTRACT: Hodgkin\\'s disease is recognized as part of the spectrum of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), although it is still an uncommon de novo malignancy in this population. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been linked to both post-transplant non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphomas and Hodgkin\\'s disease. We report a case of recurrent Hodgkin\\'s disease in a patient who received a renal transplant in childhood and later developed EBV-associated Hodgkin\\'s disease with remission after chemotherapy until subsequent relapse 9 years later that was successfully treated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of recurrent Hodgkin\\'s disease in a transplant recipient. We briefly discuss the pathogenesis of and risk factors for EBV-related PTLD, utility of EBV load surveillance, and the options for treatment of PTLD including immunosuppression reduction, antiviral therapy, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, cytotoxic T cells, and the possible roles of interferon-alpha and rapamycin. TEXT: Case report The patient is a 27-year-old white man who received a living-related donor transplant from his father at 11 years of age in 1986 for end stage renal disease secondary to posterior urethral valves. The patient was seronegative for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein\\\\u2013Barr virus (EBV) prior to transplantation. His father\\'s EBV and CMV status were unavailable. The transplant course was complicated by immediate postoperative acute renal artery thrombosis, which required transplant nephrectomy. He then received a deceased donor renal transplant 10 days later. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (Sandimmune formulation), azathioprine, and prednisone. He received 12 doses of Minnesota equine antilymphocyte immunoglobulin (MALG) for induction followed by 10 doses of murine anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) for two episodes of acute graft rejection over the 7 weeks following the transplant. The deceased donor\\'s EBV and CMV status were unavailable from medical records. The patient developed acute infectious mononucleosis 2 months after transplantation demonstrated by positive EBV serology. He was treated with acyclovir and the infectious mononucleosis resolved. At the age of 18, he presented with 5 months of fever, weight-loss and night sweats, and was found to have axillary adenopathy, splenomegaly and bulky right mediastinal adenopathy. A right anterior, thoracotomy and lymph node biopsy demonstrated Hodgkin\\'s disease, nodular sclerosing subtype. Hodgkin\\'s\\\\u2013Reed\\\\u2013Sternberg (HRS) cells were strongly positive for CD30 and EBV-latent membrane protein (LMP)-1. He was staged as Hodgkin\\'s disease-IIIB. His EBV serology demonstrated elevated antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG titers and positive anti-VCA IgM, consistent with reactivation of EBV infection.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hodgkin\\'s disease, Infectious mononucleosis, Cytomegalovirus infection, Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, Pyrexia, Febrile neutropenia, Mononucleosis syndrome, CD30 expression, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type stage unspecified, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion type stage unspecified, Hodgkin\\'s disease mixed cellularity stage unspecified, Epstein-Barr virus infection, Epstein-Barr virus antibody, Hodgkin\\'s disease stage III, Cytomegalovirus mononucleosis, Hodgkin\\'s disease unclassifiable, Hodgkin\\'s disease stage IV, Hodgkin\\'s disease stage II, Lymphoma, Epstein-Barr virus test, Hodgkin\\'s disease stage I, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type stage III, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance stage II site unspec, Malignant lymphoid neoplasm, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type stage IV, Hodgkin\\'s disease recurrent, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance stage I site unspec, Hodgkin\\'s disease nodular sclerosis, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type recurrent, Epstein-Barr virus antibody positive, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type refractory, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion stage II site unspecified, Epstein-Barr virus test positive, Hepatitis infectious mononucleosis, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion type stage III, Acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis, Hodgkin\\'s disease refractory, Hepatitis B e antibody, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion type recurrent, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion stage I site unspecified, Hodgkin\\'s disease mixed cellularity stage III, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion type stage IV, Epstein-Barr virus antigen positive, Hodgkin\\'s disease mixed cellularity stage I site unspecified, Human herpesvirus 6 infection, Hodgkin\\'s disease mixed cellularity recurrent, Acute kidney injury, Hodgkin\\'s disease mixed cellularity stage IV, Anti-VGCC antibody, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion type refractory\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653442.103736}
