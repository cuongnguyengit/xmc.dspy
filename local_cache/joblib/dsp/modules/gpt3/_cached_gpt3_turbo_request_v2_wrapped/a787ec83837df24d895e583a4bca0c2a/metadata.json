ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Leukoencephalopathy is identified during the administration of anticancer drugs. Symptoms vary from neurological symptoms to psychiatric symptoms depending on the site of damage. There have been no previous reports of suicide attempts due to drug-induced leukoencephalopathy. METHODS The patient was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) infiltrating the pharyngeal lesion. Rituximab + methotrexate + oncovin + procarbazine (R-MPV) therapy, a methotrexate-containing chemotherapy, was initiated. At the end of the fifth course, the patient attempted suicide by hanging with an appliance cord, which was associated with delusion. A head MRI scan showed no evidence of lymphoma recurrence, but white matter lesions around the ventricles showed progression. CONCLUSIONS We report the case of a patient in whom drug-induced leukoencephalopathy related to methotrexate led to a suicide attempt. In addition to monitoring brain tumors, daily monitoring of psychiatric and neurological symptoms is important for patients with methotrexate-induced encephalopathy. TEXT: pmc1 INTRODUCTION Drug\\\\u2010induced leukoencephalopathy, including that induced by methotrexate, is an encephalopathy caused by abnormal brain metabolism during the administration of anticancer drugs or immunosuppressive drugs. 1 Symptoms vary from neurological symptoms to psychiatric symptoms depending on the site of damage. 2 Methotrexate has a higher affinity for intracellular dihydrofolate reductase than folic acid and indirectly inhibits the metabolism of folic acid into tetrahydrofolate (THF), which is necessary for nucleic acid synthesis. 2 , 3 Inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis also inhibits the production of methionine, which is necessary for myelination in central nervous tissue, resulting in cerebral white matter lesions. Several factors are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of drug\\\\u2010induced leukoencephalopathy, such as increased stimulation of N\\\\u2010methyl\\\\u2010D\\\\u2010aspartate (NMDA) receptors by elevated homocysteine, extracellular adenosine accumulation, and abnormal biopterin metabolism. 2 , 3 We report the case of a patient who experienced leukoencephalopathy during treatment with methotrexate, the most frequent cause of drug\\\\u2010induced leukoencephalopathy, and attempted suicide. 2 CASE PRESENTATION\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Suicide attempt, Delusion, White matter lesion, Suicidal ideation, Intentional overdose, Mixed delusion, Persecutory delusion, Delusion of reference, Death, Delusional perception, Homocysteine urine, Jealous delusion, Somatic delusion, Toxic leukoencephalopathy, Blood homocysteine, Delusional disorder unspecified type, Delusion of replacement, Completed suicide, Intentional self-injury, Delusion of theft, Delusional disorder mixed type, Delusion of grandeur, Suicide threat, Delusional disorder persecutory type, Toxic encephalopathy, Urine homocystine, Erotomanic delusion, Suicidal behaviour, Cysteine urine, Central nervous system lesion, Depressive delusion, Suspected suicide attempt, Delusional disorder grandiose type, Delusion of parasitosis, Delusional disorder somatic type, Leukoencephalopathy, Paranoia, Delusional disorder jealous type, Depression suicidal, Drug-induced liver injury, Delusional disorder erotomanic type, Suspected suicide, Assisted suicide, Tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency, Loose associations, Poverty of thought content, Homocysteine urine absent, Homocysteine urine present, Self-injurious ideation, Impaired reasoning\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706654008.9333696}
