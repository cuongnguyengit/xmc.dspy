ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Sepsis and bleeding can lead to life-threatening complications, such as stent-graft infection and pseudoaneurysm, after stent-graft implantation. An 83 year-old woman was admitted to our hospital for sepsis 14 months after treatment with a balloon-expandable stent-graft for an arterio-ureteral fistula (AUF) between the right external iliac artery and the right ureter. Blood cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Candida tropicalis. A giant infectious pseudoaneurysm (44 \\\\u00d7 70 mm) at the distal edge of the stent-graft was suspected of having caused the sepsis. Although endovascular therapy (EVT) was planned to correct the pseudoaneurysm, the right iliac artery spontaneously became occluded from the ostium of the right common iliac artery to the common femoral artery 5 days after diagnosing the pseudoaneurysm; hence, EVT was not performed. Antibiotic administration was continued, and blood culture results were negative. Although EVT using a stent graft for AUFs is effective, data on the chronic phase outcomes are limited. Therefore, patients with AUFs treated using stent-grafts should be carefully followed up. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Pseudoaneurysm formation after endovascular therapy using a stent-graft is a relatively rare but potentially life-threatening condition because of the risk of infection and bleeding [1]. Endovascular treatment of arterio-ureteral fistula (AUF) with covered stents has been described [2], [3], as endovascular treatment with stents is less invasive and provides rapid control of life-threatening bleeding. However, complications have not been commonly reported after implantation of a stent-graft for treating AUF [4], and data on outcomes in the chronic phase are limited. Here, we report a rare case of an external iliac artery pseudoaneurysm after treatment for AUF using a balloon-expandable stent-graft.
