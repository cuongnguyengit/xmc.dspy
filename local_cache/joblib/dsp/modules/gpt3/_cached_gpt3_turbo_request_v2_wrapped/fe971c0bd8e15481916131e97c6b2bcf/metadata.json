ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \\\\\"found down\\\\\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \\\\u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \\\\u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\\\\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\\\\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \\\\u201ccatch up\\\\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Insomnia, Compartment syndrome, Crush syndrome, Somnolence, Acute kidney injury, Fatigue, Sleep disorder, Sleep deficit, Poor quality sleep, Sleep inertia, Sleep terror, Irregular sleep phase, Behavioural induced insufficient sleep syndrome, Middle insomnia, Parasomnia, Dyssomnia, Terminal insomnia, Abnormal sleep-related event, Abdominal compartment syndrome, Delayed sleep phase, Psychophysiologic insomnia, Paradoxical insomnia, Advanced sleep phase, Somnambulism, Crush injury, Sleep attacks, Sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, Hyposomnia, Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, Orbital compartment syndrome, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition insomnia type, Condition aggravated, Initial insomnia, Irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition parasomnia type, Hypersomnia, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition mixed type, Myalgia, Bedridden, Behavioural insomnia of childhood, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition hypersomnia type, Decompression sickness, Breathing-related sleep disorder, Loss of dreaming, Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Rapid eye movements sleep abnormal, Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Lethargy, Crushing injury of trunk, Sudden onset of sleep\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Deep vein thrombosis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. However, its association with adenomatous polyposis coli is extremely rare. Here we present an interesting case of deep vein thrombosis associated with adenomatous polyposis coli. METHODS A 15 year old female who was having fever and diarrhea for 5 months developed bilateral asymmetric painful swelling of lower limbs for 1 month. Doppler ultrasound of lower limbs revealed presence of thrombosis from inferior vena cava up to popliteal vein. Colonoscopy and biopsy were suggestive of adenomatous polyposis coli. However, she could not tolerate anticoagulant therapy and was put on aspirin therapy for 6 months to which she responded well with the resolution of thrombus. CONCLUSIONS Role of aspirin therapy may be considered whenever a patient of venous thrombosis cannot tolerate anticoagulant therapy. TEXT: Venous thromboembolism is an important cause of hospital acquired morbidity and mortality (1). Its association with adenomatous polyposis coli is a rare event (2, 3). Malignancy or major operative procedure associated with colonic polyp may predispose to thromboembolic event (2). There has been previously published few reports of diarrhea associated with deep vein thrombosis (4-6). Etiology of diarrhea in those cases was unrelated to colonic polyp. However, association of deep vein thrombosis with non-malignant colonic polyp presenting with diarrhea is an extremely rare event with a report of only one case in previous English literature (3). Mainstay of therapy of deep vein thrombosis is anticoagulation. However, fatal bleeding episode following anticoagulation in our patient lead to withdrawal of anticoagulation therapy. The patient was treated successfully with low dose aspirin therapy (75mg/day) with complete resolution of thrombus. Case Presentation A 15-year-old unmarried female presented to us with complain of asymmetric onset lower limb swelling for last 1 month. The swelling initially involved the left lower limb and for last 1 week she had also developed right lower limb swelling. The swelling which was initially painless later became painful. She was also having low grade irregular fever for last 5 months along with small amount of non-foul smelling mucus containing recurrent episodes of diarrhea for the same duration along with a history of significant weight loss. She had an episode of hematochezia 1 day after admission. There was no history of abdominal pain, vomiting, abdominal distension, facial puffiness, oliguria, bleeding from any other sites, joint pain, skin rash, recent contact with tuberculosis, recent surgery or prolonged immobilization. She had mild pallor and her body mass index (BMI) was 17.5 kg/mt2. She had bilateral pitting pedal edema along with raised local temperature and a positive Homans\\\\u2019 sign and Moses\\\\u2019 sign.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Diarrhoea, Weight decreased, Deep vein thrombosis, Decreased appetite, Constipation, Weight increased, Venous thrombosis, Adenomatous polyposis coli, Abnormal loss of weight, Weight loss poor, Vomiting, Fatigue, Weight gain poor, Body mass index decreased, Diarrhoea infectious, Underweight, Nausea, Venous thrombosis limb, Weight abnormal, Thrombosis, Post procedural diarrhoea, Thrombosed varicose vein, Diarrhoea haemorrhagic, Bacterial diarrhoea, Embolism venous, Peripheral vein thrombus extension, Pelvic venous thrombosis, Frequent bowel movements, Weight, Thrombophlebitis, Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome, Defaecation disorder, Fat tissue decreased, Defaecation urgency, Deep vein thrombosis postoperative, Diarrhoea neonatal, Hepatic vein thrombosis, Colitis, Obesity, Pulmonary venous thrombosis, Overweight, Abnormal weight gain, Viral diarrhoea, Colon adenoma, Weight fluctuation, Clostridium difficile colitis, Gastrointestinal disorder, Visceral venous thrombosis, Portal vein thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
