ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: The peritonitis caused by gram-negative organisms is a serious complication encountered in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, often causing high morbidity and mortality. There has been recognition of peritonitis caused by uncommon organisms because of improved microbiological detection techniques. The healthcare providers involved in the management of these patients should be very vigilant. We report a rare case of peritonitis caused by Citrobacter freundii. A 42-year-old male on peritoneal dialysis for five years presented with abdominal pain and cloudy effluent. The peritoneal fluid analysis was consistent with peritonitis, and peritoneal fluid culture grew Citrobacter freundii. The patient was treated with two courses of double antibiotic coverage with intraperitoneal ceftazidime and oral ciprofloxacin, which failed to resolve the infection and hence resulted in the removal the peritoneal dialysis catheter and dialysis modality change. TEXT: Introduction Gram-negative organism peritonitis is a severe complication encountered in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, often causing high morbidity and mortality. The healthcare providers involved in the care of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis should recognize that unusual organisms could cause peritonitis. We report the case of a 42-year-old male on peritoneal dialysis presenting with Citrobacter freundii peritonitis. Citrobacter freundii (C. freundii) is a motile, facultative anaerobe, non-sporing gram-negative bacilli colonize in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other animals. It is also found in water, soil, and food.1 Werkman and Gillen discovered genus Citrobacter in 1932 and the organism uses citrate a sole carbon source for the energy source and hence derives its name.2 C. freundii is hydrogen sulfide positive, indole negative, adonitol negative, and malonate negative in character.3 Peritonitis from gram-negative organisms frequently results in hospitalization, catheter loss, dialysis modality change, and mortality. These infections are hard to treat because of biofilm formation, which makes them less susceptible to antibiotics.

The article discusses a case of peritonitis in a patient undergoing peritoneal dialysis, caused by Citrobacter freundii. It mentions that the patient presented with abdominal pain and cloudy effluent, which are symptoms of peritonitis. The peritonitis was severe enough to require hospitalization, catheter loss, dialysis modality change, and it is noted that such infections can lead to mortality. The infection was resistant to the initial antibiotic treatment, as indicated by the failure of two courses of antibiotics, leading to the removal of the peritoneal dialysis catheter.
