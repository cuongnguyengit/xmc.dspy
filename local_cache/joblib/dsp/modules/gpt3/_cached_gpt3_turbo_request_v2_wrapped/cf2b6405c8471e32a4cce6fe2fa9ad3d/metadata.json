ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Resistant hyponatraemia in a patient with follicular lymphoma and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction: a case report. ABSTRACT: Hyponatraemia is a common problem in patients with heart failure. It can be difficult to treat, especially in the presence of the patient\\'s needs for diuresis and manipulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This concerns a 74-year-old woman with follicular lymphoma and severe global left ventricular systolic dysfunction secondary to treatment with R-CHOP chemotherapy. She presented a difficult challenge in the management of her decompensated heart failure alongside hyponatraemia as low as 113 mmol/L. This was resistant to standard treatment. The resistance to usual measures necessitated treatment with Tolvaptan, a selective arginine vasopressin V2 inhibitor used to treat hyponatraemia in syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone. This, along with a strict fluid restriction of 500 mL/day, resolved the patient\\'s hyponatraemia and enabled her discharge home on tolerated heart failure treatment. She has now remained stable for almost 12 months. The potential causes of hyponatraemia are discussed along with the role of Tolvaptan in its management. TEXT: Learning points Hyponatraemia is a common part of acute medical presentations, especially in the elderly. It is closely related to patients\\\\u2019 overall fluid status and can be caused or exacerbated by heart failure treatment. Tolvaptan is a selective arginine vasopressin V2 inhibitor that promotes free water excretion and helps to normalize sodium levels. It can lead to a sudden rise in the sodium level. Therefore, it should be initiated under specialist supervision, and with close monitoring of U+Es. Sudden significant sodium rise, especially in pre-existing chronic hyponatraemia, can precipitate osmotic demyelination syndrome, a debilitating and potentially irreversible degenerative neurological condition. Introduction Hyponatraemia is common in clinical practice, reported to occur in 15\\\\u201330% of adults.1 The Organized Program to Initiate Life Saving Treatment in Patients Hospitalized for Heart Failure (OPTIMIZE-HF) registry showed that 25.3% of the 47 647 patients with heart failure (HF) had hyponatraemia on admission to the hospital.2 The following case illustrates important learning points on fluid status management and specialist input into the management of hyponatraemia in HF.
