ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Survival and relative dose intensity of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin and irinotecan in real-life treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. ABSTRACT: Combinations of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI) are part of standard treatments for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). For these molecules, the impact of a low relative dose intensity (RDI) on survival is not sufficiently known in real-life. Data were collected retrospectively from patients treated in our center for an unresectable mCRC with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI as a first-line treatment. To study the impact on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), patients were divided into high and low RDI according to the median RDI of 5-FU on one end, and the median RDI of oxaliplatin or irinotecan (OXA-IRI) on the other. In our population of 75 patients, the median age was 67.1 years and 77% of patients were treated with FOLFIRI. Patients with high RDI for OXA-IRI had better PFS compared to patients with low RDI (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; p = 0.03). There was no statistically significant difference in PFS for patients with high RDI for 5-FU (HR, 0.66; p = 0.09). No difference was found in overall survival according to the RDI of OXA-IRI (HR, 0.72; p = 0.18) or 5-FU (HR, 0.77; p = 0.29). RDI had no significant impact on toxicities. Our analysis suggests that a low RDI of oxaliplatin and irinotecan has a negative effect on PFS. RDI had no significant effect on OS in our cohort. The clinical benefit of maintaining high RDI in these patients appears low. TEXT: Introduction In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with unresectable metastases, the combination of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX regimen) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI regimen) is part of the first-line standard treatment that improved patient survival when compared to 5-FU/LV administered alone [1\\\\u20134]. The use of monoclonal antibodies against VEGF and EGFR has also proved beneficial in this situation [5]. These treatments are intended to be administered at a certain dose and regimen. However, due to the onset of toxicities, it is common in clinical practice to make dose reductions or delay the administration of these molecules, which has the consequence of decreasing the relative dose intensity (RDI) [6, 7]. In many cancers, low chemotherapy RDI is associated with decreased disease control and survival [8\\\\u201311]. With regard to mCRC, certain retrospective analyses of patients treated with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI have highlighted a link between survival and RDI of oxaliplatin and irinotecan [12, 13]. For 5-FU, one study has shown a possible link between RDI and response rate [14]; however, these results were not confirmed in a second trial when 5-FU was combined with LV [15]. In these studies, data resulted from clinical trials. As far as is known, in real-life, no study has shown a negative impact on survival of a low RDI of oxaliplatin, irinotecan or 5-FU in patients treated with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI [16, 17].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Death, Toxicity to various agents, Disease progression, Colorectal cancer metastatic, Colon cancer metastatic, Poisoning, Neurotoxicity, Colorectal cancer stage IV, Rectosigmoid cancer metastatic, Metastases to rectum, Rectal cancer metastatic, Malignant neoplasm progression, Condition aggravated, Colon cancer stage IV, Intestinal metastasis, Rectosigmoid cancer stage IV, Drug ineffective, Off label use, Colorectal cancer, Terminal state, Rectal cancer stage IV, Drug interaction, Overdose, Anal cancer metastatic, Treatment failure, Gastrointestinal cancer metastatic, Cancer in remission, Prophylaxis, Metastases to gastrointestinal tract, Colon cancer, Clinical death, Quarantine, Systemic toxicity, Chemical poisoning, Colorectal cancer stage II, Colorectal cancer stage I, Metastasis, Colorectal cancer stage III, Rectosigmoid cancer, Metastases to central nervous system, Metastatic neoplasm, Drug intolerance, Second primary malignancy, Anal cancer stage IV, Blood folate, Pyrexia, Colorectal cancer recurrent, Colon cancer stage I, Metastases to lung, Colon cancer stage II\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
