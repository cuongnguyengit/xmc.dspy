ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Torsades de pointes episode in a woman with high-grade fever and inflammatory activation: A case report. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND QT interval prolongation can induce torsades de pointes (TdP), a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Recently, an increasing number of non-cardiac drugs have been found to cause QT prolongation and/or TdP onset. Moreover, recent findings have demonstrated the key roles of systemic inflammatory activation and fever in promoting long-QT syndrome (LQTS) and TdP development. METHODS A 30-year-old woman was admitted with a moderate to high-grade episodic fever for two weeks. The patient was administered with multiple antibiotics after hospitalization but still had repeating fever and markedly elevated C-reactive protein. Once after a high fever, the patient suddenly lost consciousness, and electrocardiogram (ECG) showed transient TdP onset after frequent premature ventricular contraction. The patient recovered sinus rhythm and consciousness spontaneously, and post-TdP ECG revealed a prolonged QTc interval of 560 ms. The patient\\'s clinical manifestations and unresponsiveness to the antibiotics led to the final diagnosis of adult-onset Still\\'s disease (AOSD). There was no evidence of cardiac involvement. After the AOSD diagnosis, discontinuation of antibiotics and immediate initiation of intravenous dexamethasone administration resulted in the normal temperature and QTc interval. The genetic analysis identified that the patient and her father had heterozygous mutations in KCNH2 (c.1370C>T) and AKAP9 (c.7725A>C). During the 2-year follow-up period, the patient had no recurrence of any arrhythmia and maintained normal QTc interval. CONCLUSIONS This case study highlights the risk of systemic inflammatory activation and antibiotic-induced TdP/LQTS onset. Genetic analysis should be considered to identify individuals at high risk of developing TdP. TEXT: Core Tip: Torsades de pointes (TdP) is a life-threatening arrhythmia and may be caused by congenital long QT syndrome (cLQTS) or acquired LQTS (aLQTS). Meanwhile, aLQTS may share a similar genetic background with cLQTS. Here, we present a case of TdP episode during the combination of antibiotics for high-grade fever of unexplained origin before a confirmed diagnosis of adult-onset Still\\\\u2019s disease (AOSD). This case study highlights the importance of early diagnosis of AOSD, the key role of systemic inflammatory activation, and the risk of antibiotic-induced TdP/LQTS onset. Genetic analysis should be considered to identify individuals at high risk of developing TdP.
