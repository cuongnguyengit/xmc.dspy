ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Intravenous immunoglobulin is a recognized treatment in recalcitrant autoimmune bullous diseases. Infusions are administered monthly over 1-5 days in the hospital setting and associated with mild to severe infusion-related systemic effects, in part due to the high doses necessary to induce and achieve remission. We present a case series of four patients with bullous diseases treated successfully with low-dose subcutaneous IgG who achieved remission with maintenance therapy. Patient-administered smaller, more frequent doses of IgG into subcutaneous tissue more closely mimics the body\\'s own antibody production and produces a more stable serum trough level. Subcutaneous IgG is a novel treatment approach in bullous diseases which can induce a state remission. TEXT: Introduction Autoimmune bullous diseases are characterized by bullous lesions to the skin and mucous membranes of the oral cavity, nose, eyes, larynx, pharynx, esophagus, and genitals.1 Once considered fatal conditions, treatment options have evolved from corticosteroids to steroid-sparing immunosuppressant drugs (methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine and mycophenolic acid (MMF)), monoclonal antibodies (rituximab), and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).2\\\\u20134 IVIG is a human plasma derivative containing IgG and has been used in conjunction with conventional therapy to treat refractory bullous diseases.2,4 Subcutaneous IgG (SCIG) is an effective alternative for patients refractory to or unable to tolerate immunosuppressive therapy.4 Moreover, it has been shown to be more cost-effective than immunosuppressives, which can result in significant toxicities requiring hospitalization.5 The immunomodulatory effects are complex and multifaceted, including increased catabolism of autoantibodies, inhibition in autoantibody function, and decrease in plasma inflammatory markers.2,3,6 Optimal dosing varies but follows similar conventional weight-based approaches (300\\\\u2013400 mg/kg/month) as well as higher doses (2 g/kg over 2\\\\u20135 days/month) in aggressive disease.2,4,7 Adverse events can be mild (headaches, backaches, hives), severe (anaphylaxis, thromboembolism), and are usually infusion-related and self-limiting. However, adverse events increase with higher doses and may interfere with patient\\\\u2019s quality of life.3,6 The goal of therapy in the bullous diseases is to induce and maintain remission, as evidenced by the cessation of new vesicle and bullae formation and healing of old lesions.3,8 Long-term therapy may be required in recalcitrant disease and may be associated with significant toxicities if corticosteroids or immunosuppressants are needed, particularly in elderly patients with bullous pemphigoid.8 In the present case series, we describe the use of low-dose SCIG (Hizentra; CSL Behring Inc) to safely induce and maintain long-term remissions in four patients\\\\n\\\\nOptions: No adverse event, Fatigue, Neutropenia, Drug ineffective, Asthenia, Nausea, Alopecia, Sensory level normal, No reaction on previous exposure to drug, Muscle strength normal, Breath sounds absent, Decreased activity, Nothing by mouth order, Unevaluable therapy, Nocardiosis, Headache, Vital dye staining cornea absent, Nocturia, Pain threshold decreased, Decreased appetite, Pain, Malnutrition, Non-pitting oedema, Non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma unspecified histology indolent, Therapy naive, Muscular weakness, Weight decreased, Neuropathy peripheral, Hypoaesthesia, Therapy non-responder, Hypokinesia, Uncircumcised, Sensory loss, Non-scarring alopecia, Sperm concentration zero, Inadequate analgesia, Starvation, Inadequate diet, Non-dipping, Tenderness, Wound healing normal, Non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma unspecified histology indolent stage I, Discomfort, Tender joint count decreased, Hypotrichosis, Homans\\' sign negative, Nutritional condition normal, General physical health deterioration, General physical condition normal, Tender joint count\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

The article discusses the use of subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCIG) as a treatment for autoimmune bullous diseases and compares it to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). It mentions that IVIG is associated with mild to severe infusion-related systemic effects. Specific adverse events related to IVIG are listed as headaches, backaches, hives, anaphylaxis, and thromboembolism.
