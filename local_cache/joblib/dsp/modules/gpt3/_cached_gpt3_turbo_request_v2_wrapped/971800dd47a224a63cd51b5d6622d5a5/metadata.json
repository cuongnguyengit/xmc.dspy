ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can in general be used safely in daily clinical practice. However, under the right circumstances, it can lead to serious complications. A 68-year-old female patient with diabetes and a history of inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction 8 years earlier, visited our outpatient clinic with atypical chest discomfort. In order to assess whether this is due to myocardial ischaemia, MPI-SPECT was ordered. As it was suspected she would not achieve sufficient exercise levels, pharmacologic stress using adenosine was arranged. During the scan, she developed acute myocardial infarction. Subsequent urgent coronary angiography demonstrated a subtotal stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery which was successfully stented. She was still free from angina 4 months later. The combination of a reduced systemic and coronary perfusion pressure in the presence of an exhausted coronary autoregulation, may be a starting point for local geometrical changes that initiate the classic cascade of thrombus formation and acute occlusion of coronary arteries during MPI-SPECT. This illustrates the need for continuous patient and electrocardiogram monitoring. TEXT: Learning points Adenosine stress testing leading to acute myocardial infarction is a rare but major side effect. In patients undergoing adenosine stress testing, continuous electrocardiograms (ECGs) monitoring should be preferred over symptom driven ECG monitoring. The interpretation of chest pain is challenging in (female) diabetic patients. Introduction One of the challenges in daily clinical practice is to objectify the presence and extent of myocardial ischaemia. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is one the preferred methods, frequently using pharmacologic stress testing with adenosine. Common side effects of adenosine include flushing, dyspnoea, gastrointestinal discomfort, chest pain, and headache.1 Timeline 2010 Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) right coronary artery for inferior myocardial infarction 2018 August Recurrence of chest pain October Visit to cardiology outpatient department 21 November Myocardial perfusion imaging (adenosine-induced stress) 21 November Admission to hospital and PCI left anterior descending coronary artery 23 November Discharge form hospital in good condition 2019 March Free from angina at outpatient clinic Case presentation A 68-year-old female patient with a history of inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) 8 years earlier visited our outpatient clinic.
