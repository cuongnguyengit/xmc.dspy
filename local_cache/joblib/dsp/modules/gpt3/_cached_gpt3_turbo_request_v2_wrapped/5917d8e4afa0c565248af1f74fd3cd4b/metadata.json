ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Amniotic fluid embolism is a rare, often fatal complication of labor and delivery. The classic presentation is the sudden onset of a triad of clinical manifestations: hypoxia, hypotension and coagulopathy. Understanding of the syndrome as an immunologically mediated, complicated and often catastrophic maternal response to fetal or placental antigens is coming into focus. New treatments such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and better use of old treatments such as transfusion offer hope, but the condition is often rapidly fatal, so saving the maternal and fetal lives depends on rapid recognition of the syndrome. This series of three cases illustrates the clinical features enabling the rapid recognition needed for successful treatment of amniotic fluid embolism syndrome. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Labor and delivery have the potential to become a critical experience for mother and baby. The obstetrician must always be on high alert for the rare emergency. Sudden cardiovascular collapse during labor and delivery can be due to pulmonary thromboembolism, hemorrhage, venous air embolism, anaphylaxis, high cephalad spread of epidural anesthesia, peripartum cardiomyopathy, eclampsia or amniotic fluid embolism.1 Among these complications, amniotic fluid embolism remains one of the most feared because of its suddenness, severity and frequently fatal outcome. Emerging life-saving treatments for amniotic fluid embolism make it more promising to successfully treat this life-threatening cause of cardiovascular collapse during labor and delivery. This series of three cases is reported in detail to highlight the variability in presentation and provide a didactic review to encourage rapid recognition and intervention. CASE 1 This 35-year-old mother of two was admitted to an urban hospital in the Midwest USA at 37 4/7 weeks gestation at 09:21 with spontaneous rupture of membranes since 04:00. She was having irregular mild contractions. Group B Streptococcus had been isolated. Her outpatient medications included only salmeterol/fluticasone inhaler for asthma, and prenatal vitamins. The patient\\'s temperature was 36.3o C, pulse 86/minute, blood pressure 135/85 mm Hg and respirations 20/minute. Fetal heart rate was normal at 120-130/minute. At 10:15 the patient\\'s hemoglobin was 11.6 g/dL. (RR: 11.7-15.7 g/dL). An intravenous infusion of lactated Ringer\\'s solution was started, and the patient received prophylactic penicillin. Oxytocin augmentation was started. A total of 24 MU of oxytocin was given from 13:30 to 18:15. Labor proceeded uneventfully, with the cervix dilated to 5 cm, until about nine hours after admission.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Oxytocin, Oxytocin increased, Vitamin supplementation, Vitamin A, Oxytocin challenge test, Drug interaction, Vitamin E, Carotene, Oxytocin abnormal, Vitamin B1, Vitamin D, Oxytocin decreased, Condition aggravated, Oxytocin normal, Vitamin A normal, Vitamin B12, Nicotinamide, Carotene normal, Paternal drugs affecting foetus, Blood 1.25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, Vitamin B2, Vitamin C, Mineral supplementation, Foetal exposure during pregnancy, Retinol binding protein, Vitamin B6, Blood corticotrophin, Blood 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, Maternal exposure during pregnancy, Blood corticotrophin increased, Vitamin B6 normal, Maternal drugs affecting foetus, Nutritional supplementation, Controlled ovarian stimulation, Blood glucagon, Placenta growth factor, Labour augmentation, Prenatal screening test, Vocal cord augmentation, Cerebral vasodilatation, ACTH stimulation test, Blood prolactin increased, Blood folate, Vitamin C normal, Insulin shock therapy, Antiprolactin therapy, Vasopressive therapy, Urine retinol binding protein, Exposure during pregnancy, Overdose\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

The article discusses amniotic fluid embolism, which is a rare and often fatal complication of labor and delivery. The classic presentation includes hypoxia, hypotension, and coagulopathy. The article also mentions the use of oxytocin augmentation during labor. While the article does not explicitly list adverse reactions to medications, we can infer that the use of oxytocin is related to labor augmentation, which is a treatment rather than an adverse reaction. The article does not mention any adverse reactions to vitamins or other substances listed in the options.
