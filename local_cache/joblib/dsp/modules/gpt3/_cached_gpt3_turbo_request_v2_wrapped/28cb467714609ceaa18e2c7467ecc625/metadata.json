ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Temporary transvenous pacing through the coronary sinus is a novel approach rarely used in treating unstable bradycardia. This modality could provide cardiac pacing while achieving better ventricular synchrony. We present a case who received cardiac pacing through the coronary sinus and provide a summary of evidence in the current literature. METHODS A 55-year-old woman with a history of advanced heart failure was admitted to the rehabilitation ward after a recent stroke. During hospitalization, she had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response resulting from fluid overload. While atrial fibrillation was spontaneously reversed to sinus rhythm after diuresis, she developed multiple episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia along with sinus bradycardia and prolonged QTc interval. She became hypotensive despite appropriate medical management. Pacing through her implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was attempted but worsened her hypotension. Ventricular dyssynchrony was suspected. Temporary transvenous atrial pacing through the coronary sinus was performed, which stabilized her blood pressure and improved end-organ perfusion. A permanent biventricular pacemaker was later implanted, and she was safely discharged to a nursing home. CONCLUSIONS Temporary transvenous pacing through the coronary sinus, a novel approach to treat unstable bradycardia, may reduce ventricular dyssynchrony. TEXT: Core Tip: We present a case who received cardiac pacing through the coronary sinus and provide a summary of evidence in the current literature. A 55-year-old woman with unstable bradycardia complicating cardiogenic shock achieved cardiac resynchronization with placement of a temporary pacing wire to the coronary sinus. This modality, compared to pacing through the right ventricle apex, may induce a more physiologic ventricular depolarization and decrease ventricular dyssynchrony. This approach was safely applied in patients who had risks of ventricular dyssynchrony or required temporary atrial pacing. Pitfalls such as technical requirements and potential complications should be considered prior to electrode lead placement.
