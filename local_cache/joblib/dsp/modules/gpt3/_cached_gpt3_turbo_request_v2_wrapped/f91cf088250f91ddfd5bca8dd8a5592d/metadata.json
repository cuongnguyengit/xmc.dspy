ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin usually reserved to treat severe infections or those caused by multi-resistant microorganisms. Neurotoxicity is attributed to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier and produce gamma-aminobutyric acid antagonism. Neurological symptoms may range from mild somnolence to seizures and coma. Our patient is an 88-year-old man who presented from a nursing home due to worsening pressure ulcers. After cefepime was started, he started developing worsening altered mental status and hallucinations. Cefepime was discontinued and his neurological symptoms improved shortly afterward. He was discharged to a long-term acute facility for antibiotic therapy where he recovered. Our case illustrates a commonly missed side effect of cefepime. Prompt recognition of this adverse effect is paramount to prevent disease progression and avoid permanent neurological damage. TEXT: Introduction Cefepime is a broad-spectrum, fourth-generation cephalosporin that binds to and inactivates penicillin-binding proteins located on the bacterial cell wall [1]. It is known to cause central nervous system depression by its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and antagonize gamma-aminobutyric acid class A (GABA-A) in a concentration-dependent manner. This may be further worsened by impaired kidney function and concomitant diseases (e.g., sepsis, chronic inflammation), inhibiting drug metabolism and leading to increased serum concentration [2]. The incidence of neurotoxicity ranges from 1% to 15% due to the underrecognition of this phenomenon by clinicians [3].
