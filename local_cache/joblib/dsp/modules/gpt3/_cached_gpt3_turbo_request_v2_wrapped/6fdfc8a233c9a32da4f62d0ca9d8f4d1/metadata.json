The vacancy mentions a degree in \\\\\"Production Mechanical Electrical Marine Engineering (or similar)\\\\\" and the candidate might be \\\\\"newly educated.\\\\\" This suggests that the job requires a foundational understanding of engineering principles, particularly in the fields mentioned. Since the candidate might be newly educated, we can infer that the job may not require extensive experience but rather a solid educational background in the relevant engineering disciplines. We should look for skills that are related to mechanical, electrical, and marine engineering, as well as general engineering competencies that a recent graduate might possess.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: marine engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, operate mechanical equipment of ships, manage ship electrical systems, operate ship equipment, maintain shipboard machinery, maritime transportation technology, offshore constructions and facilities, provide support in vessel machinery systems\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: SQL experience is a plus but not required\\\\n\\\\nOptions: SQL, SQL Server, database, MySQL, use databases, PostgreSQL, Oracle Relational Database, data warehouse, database management systems, use query languages, query languages, manage database, Microsoft Access, operate relational database management system, database development tools, maintain database, data analytics, Teradata Database, CA Datacom/DB, business intelligence, Solidity, SPARQL, search databases, database quality standards, perform data mining, perform records management, data models, data mining, Drupal, maintain database performance, create data models, NoSQL, create database diagrams, manage quantitative data, implement data warehousing techniques, develop data processing applications, PHP, accounting, C#, design database scheme, SAP Data Services, DB2, use logic programming, manage data, data storage, balance database resources, SAS Data Management, perform data analysis, use accounting systems, use data processing techniques\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as beneficial for the job vacancy. The vacancy mentions \\\\\"SQL experience is a plus but not required,\\\\\" which suggests that while SQL skills are advantageous, they are not a mandatory requirement for the job. Therefore, we should focus on skills related to SQL and databases, as these are the most relevant to the statement provided.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: Skills: SQL, use databases, use query languages, query languages, manage database, database management systems, operate relational database management system, maintain database, create data models, manage data\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: As a person you are innovative and solution-oriented .\\\\n\\\\nOptions: think innovately, create solutions to problems, develop strategy to solve problems, solve problems, apply problem solving in social service, systems thinking, social innovation, results-based management, approach challenges positively, innovate in ICT, apply organisational techniques, think creatively, develop solutions to information issues, innovation processes, apply systemic design thinking, seek innovation in current practices, Incremental development, provide improvement strategies, software design methodologies, develop creative ideas, apply strategic thinking, solve technical problems, Solidity, address problems critically, solve problems in healthcare, Iterative development, brainstorm ideas, create working methodology, develop program ideas, problem-solving with digital tools, customise project methodologies, object-oriented modelling, use object-oriented programming, innovation in nursing, use logic programming, ICT problem management techniques, design thinking, contribute to practice innovation in health care, Process-based management, design principles, create new concepts, project management, use functional programming, solution deployment, entrepreneurship, research new ideas, think analytically, organisational policies, Waterfall development, show initiative\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as beneficial for the job vacancy. The vacancy describes the candidate as \\\\\"innovative and solution-oriented.\\\\\" This suggests that the job requires creativity, the ability to come up with new ideas, and the capacity to solve problems effectively.
