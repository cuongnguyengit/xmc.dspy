ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\\\\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\\\\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\\\\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \\\\u201cI think I\\\\u2019m having a stroke.\\\\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\\\\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Hypokalaemia, Anxiety, Hypomagnesaemia, Blood pressure increased, Hypotension, Hyponatraemia, Alcohol abuse, Hyperkalaemia, Hypocalcaemia, Alcohol use disorder, Blood potassium decreased, Alcoholism, Alcohol problem, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Drug abuse, Alcohol use, Anxiety disorder, Labile hypertension, Malignant hypertension, Hypokalaemic syndrome, Panic reaction, Alcoholic, Hypertensive urgency, Essential hypertension, Hypermagnesaemia, Nervousness, Urine potassium decreased, Alcohol poisoning, Panic disorder, Fear, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Alcoholic psychosis, Panic attack, Hypertensive angiopathy, Orthostatic hypertension, Generalised anxiety disorder, Alkalosis hypokalaemic, Electrolyte imbalance, Phobia, Alcoholic coma, Blood magnesium decreased, Idiosyncratic alcohol intoxication, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Renal hypertension, Blood alcohol, Prehypertension\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: To examine the feasibility of low-charge electrotherapy (LCE) in treating geriatric major depressive disorder (MDD) patients. Bi-temporal LCEs (approximately 25 mC) were performed with an electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) instrument three times per week. We used the Hamilton Depression Scale 17 (HAMD-17) and the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) to assess the effects of LCE and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) to evaluate the cognitive function change before and after LCE. Six visits occurred at the baseline, after LCE sessions 3, 6, and 9, after the last session, and at the end of the one-month follow-up period. Four patients were enrolled in the study. Two patients completed all LCE sessions. Two patients withdrew during the trial, one due to the adverse event of uroschesis potentially caused by atropine and the other due to her own will. All four patients completed the follow-up sessions. The HAMD-17 and HAMA scores were reduced significantly at the last LCE session and the end of the follow-up period compared with the scores at the baseline. As measured by the MMSE, cognitive impairment showed no significant changes at the last LCE session and the end of the follow-up period compared with that at the baseline. In this case series, LCE showed potential as an alternative current-based treatment for treating geriatric MDD patients. Further research is needed to assess the efficiency and safety of LCE. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Geriatric major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most severe health problems in the world. As MDD causes a series of serious problems in elderly patients, rapid remission in geriatric MDD patients is important [1]. Routine first-line procedures, such as antidepressants or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), are insufficient for geriatric MDD patients; 55\\\\u201381% of elderly patients fail to improve with first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) treatments. Electro-convulsive therapy (ECT), the most effective therapy for severe depression, has been used in clinical practice for decades. ECT has shown significant efficacy in geriatric MDD patients [2,3]. However, ECT also has a number of side effects, such as headache, delirium, forgetfulness, and cognitive impairment [1], which are especially severe among geriatric patients [4]. As a result, many elderly patients refuse ECT treatment, leading to a delay in the remission of depression and even loss of life. Some more recent procedures with fewer side effects, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS), are used to treat MDD [1,5,6]. However, these new treatments are less effective than ECT [6-8]. Therefore, improving ECT to retain its therapeutic efficacy while minimizing its side effects will strongly benefit MDD patients.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Electroconvulsive therapy, Transcranial magnetic stimulation, Deep brain stimulation, Abdominal pain, Central nervous system stimulation, Seizure, Dysuria, Ureteral spasm, Epilepsy surgery, Diadynamic electrotherapy, Transcranial electrical motor evoked potential monitoring, Oliguria, Urinary retention, Electroporation therapy, Lower urinary tract symptoms, Seizure prophylaxis, Renal impairment, Sleep disorder therapy, Paruresis, Uridrosis, Electrodesiccation, Urinary tract pain, Urinary tract obstruction, Magnetic therapy, Irreversible electroporation, Electric shock, Nerve stimulation test, Constipation, Urinary straining, Urine output, Renal colic, Diarrhoea, Epilepsy, Stereotactic electroencephalography, Electron radiation therapy to brain, Bladder spasm, Micturition urgency, Sedative therapy, Urinary tract discomfort, Electrocution, Bladder pain, Back pain, Hypnotherapy, Polyuria, Ureteric obstruction, Somatosensory evoked potentials, Peripheral nerve neurostimulation, Muscle electrostimulation therapy, Bone electrostimulation therapy, Urine output increased\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653725.5956414}
