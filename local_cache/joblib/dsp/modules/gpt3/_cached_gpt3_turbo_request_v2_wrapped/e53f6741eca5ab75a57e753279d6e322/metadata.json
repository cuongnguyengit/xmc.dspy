ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\\\\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\\\\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\\\\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \\\\u201cI think I\\\\u2019m having a stroke.\\\\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\\\\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Hypokalaemia, Anxiety, Hypomagnesaemia, Blood pressure increased, Hypotension, Hyponatraemia, Alcohol abuse, Hyperkalaemia, Hypocalcaemia, Alcohol use disorder, Blood potassium decreased, Alcoholism, Alcohol problem, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Drug abuse, Alcohol use, Anxiety disorder, Labile hypertension, Malignant hypertension, Hypokalaemic syndrome, Panic reaction, Alcoholic, Hypertensive urgency, Essential hypertension, Hypermagnesaemia, Nervousness, Urine potassium decreased, Alcohol poisoning, Panic disorder, Fear, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Alcoholic psychosis, Panic attack, Hypertensive angiopathy, Orthostatic hypertension, Generalised anxiety disorder, Alkalosis hypokalaemic, Electrolyte imbalance, Phobia, Alcoholic coma, Blood magnesium decreased, Idiosyncratic alcohol intoxication, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Renal hypertension, Blood alcohol, Prehypertension\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Combinations of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI) are part of standard treatments for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). For these molecules, the impact of a low relative dose intensity (RDI) on survival is not sufficiently known in real-life. Data were collected retrospectively from patients treated in our center for an unresectable mCRC with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI as a first-line treatment. To study the impact on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), patients were divided into high and low RDI according to the median RDI of 5-FU on one end, and the median RDI of oxaliplatin or irinotecan (OXA-IRI) on the other. In our population of 75 patients, the median age was 67.1 years and 77% of patients were treated with FOLFIRI. Patients with high RDI for OXA-IRI had better PFS compared to patients with low RDI (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; p = 0.03). There was no statistically significant difference in PFS for patients with high RDI for 5-FU (HR, 0.66; p = 0.09). No difference was found in overall survival according to the RDI of OXA-IRI (HR, 0.72; p = 0.18) or 5-FU (HR, 0.77; p = 0.29). RDI had no significant impact on toxicities. Our analysis suggests that a low RDI of oxaliplatin and irinotecan has a negative effect on PFS. RDI had no significant effect on OS in our cohort. The clinical benefit of maintaining high RDI in these patients appears low. TEXT: Introduction In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with unresectable metastases, the combination of 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) with oxaliplatin (FOLFOX regimen) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI regimen) is part of the first-line standard treatment that improved patient survival when compared to 5-FU/LV administered alone [1\\\\u20134]. The use of monoclonal antibodies against VEGF and EGFR has also proved beneficial in this situation [5]. These treatments are intended to be administered at a certain dose and regimen. However, due to the onset of toxicities, it is common in clinical practice to make dose reductions or delay the administration of these molecules, which has the consequence of decreasing the relative dose intensity (RDI) [6, 7]. In many cancers, low chemotherapy RDI is associated with decreased disease control and survival [8\\\\u201311]. With regard to mCRC, certain retrospective analyses of patients treated with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI have highlighted a link between survival and RDI of oxaliplatin and irinotecan [12, 13]. For 5-FU, one study has shown a possible link between RDI and response rate [14]; however, these results were not confirmed in a second trial when 5-FU was combined with LV [15]. In these studies, data resulted from clinical trials. As far as is known, in real-life, no study has shown a negative impact on survival of a low RDI of oxaliplatin, irinotecan or 5-FU in patients treated with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI [16, 17].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Off label use, No adverse event, Drug ineffective, Nutritional supplementation, Product used for unknown indication, Non-neutralising antibodies, Ideas of reference, Multimorbidity, Unevaluable investigation, Unevaluable therapy, Therapy non-responder, Nothing by mouth order, Drug interaction, Homeopathy, Interventional procedure, Product use in unapproved indication, Product origin unknown, Decreased activity, Uncircumcised, Collagen antigen type 1, Non-consummation, Neutralising antibodies, Enzyme supplementation, Vegan, Butanol-extractable iodine, Fatigue, Vitamin supplementation, Mineral supplementation, Calcium ionised, Non-tobacco user, Prescription drug used without a prescription, Unevaluable specimen, Vegetarian, Lipoprotein (a), Supplementation therapy, Tangentiality, Unevaluable event, Prothrombin fragment 1.2, Androgens, Monoclonal antibody unconjugated therapy, Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant, Therapeutic agent urine negative, Coagulation factor, Suspected counterfeit product, Therapeutic agent-diagnostic test interaction, Self-medication, Chemotherapeutic drug level therapeutic, Collagen antigen type IV, Abstains from alcohol, Deafness\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653714.943114}
