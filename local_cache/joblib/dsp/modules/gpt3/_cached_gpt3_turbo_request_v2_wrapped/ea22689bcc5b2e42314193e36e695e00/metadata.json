ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\\\\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are generally safe and well-tolerated drugs that are extensively used for the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. Muscle and liver adverse reactions are the best recognized, while cutaneous side effects are exceedingly rare. We present the case of a 65-year-old woman with severe hypercholesterolemia, who developed generalized erythematous cutaneous lesions with pruritus, resembling lichen planus, months after starting treatment with simvastatin. The symptoms disappeared on withdrawal of simvastatin and reappeared within 3 months upon rechallenge with rosuvastatin. In addition to describing a rare adverse effect of statins, the authors also discuss the nutraceutical approach to the management of a statin-intolerant patient. Lichenoid drug eruption is an uncommon cutaneous adverse effect of several drugs, with very few cases associated with statins.A temporal relationship, dechallenge/rechallenge information, and the lack of confounding factors or alternative explanations support the suggestion of causality.Due to the lack of optimized alternative treatment options for statin-intolerant patients, the nutraceutical approach should be considered. TEXT: INTRODUCTION 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (HMGCRi, statins) are frequently prescribed pharmaceutical products. Statins are the mainstay of the management of elevated low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in patients with high cardiovascular (CV) risk. HMGCRi are well tolerated with a good safety profile[1]. The most commonly reported side effects of statins are myotoxicity and hepatotoxicity[1]. Statins have also been associated with a number of cutaneous conditions (e.g. eczematous skin rash, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, porphyria cutanea tarda, bullous dermatosis, UV-B phototoxicity, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, cheilitis, photosensitivity and dermatomyositis-like syndrome)[2]. Lichenoid drug eruption caused by HMGCRi is exceptional[1]. We describe a lichenoid eruption linked to simvastatin and rosuvastatin and a proposed alternative regimen to reduce total cholesterol (TC) and LDL-C in a patient with a severe hypercholesterolemia phenotype. CASE REPORT A 65-year-old woman presented with symmetric eruption of flat-topped, erythematous papules on the trunk and extremities (forearms and legs), with pruritus. Some of the lesions manifested with a central pustule and marked desquamation, resembling lichen planus. Psoriasiform dermatitis on the palmar surfaces (Fig. 1) and involvement of the lateral border of the tongue was also observed. The patient mentioned similar but milder earlier episodes of cutaneous eruptions in the previous 2 years.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Pruritus, Rash pruritic, Rash, Rash pustular, Dermatitis psoriasiform, Psoriasis, Skin exfoliation, Pustule, Drug eruption, Papule, Pruritus allergic, Prurigo, Rash maculo-papular, Erythrodermic psoriasis, Pustular psoriasis, Erythema, Guttate psoriasis, Rash papular, Skin irritation, Rash erythematous, Acne pustular, Tongue movement disturbance, Tongue disorder, Paradoxical psoriasis, Ear pruritus, Application site exfoliation, Stiff tongue, Sensitive skin, Acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis, Symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema, Drug ineffective, Rash papulosquamous, Tongue paralysis, Protrusion tongue, Eczema, Mucosal exfoliation, Tongue coated, Corneal exfoliation, Rebound psoriasis, Oral lichenoid reaction, Palmoplantar pustulosis, Urticaria, Rash vesicular, Dermatitis, Tongue thrust, Application site pruritus, Nail psoriasis, Off label use, Pruritus genital, Senile pruritus\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653410.1295526}
