ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Aortocoronary arteriovenous fistula (ACAVF) due to iatrogenic bypass grafting to a cardiac vein is an exceedingly rare complication resulting from coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. If not identified in a timely fashion, ACAVF has known significant clinical consequences related to left to right shunting and possible residual myocardial ischemia. METHODS An 82-year-old male with a history of CABG, presented with dyspnea. Over the span of 2 years following CABG, the patient experienced progressive exertional dyspnea and peripheral edema. The patient was found to have a new cardiomyopathy with a severely reduced ejection fraction at 30-35%. The patient underwent diagnostic left heart catheterization, and an ACAVF was discovered between a saphenous vein graft and the coronary sinus. The patient underwent successful percutaneous coiling of the ACAVF with no residual flow. Follow-up echocardiography at 3 months revealed restoration of left ventricular systolic function to 50% and significant improvement in heart failure symptoms. CONCLUSIONS ACAVF is an exceedingly rare iatrogenic complication of CABG that may result in residual ischemia from the non-grafted myocardial territory and other sequelae relating to left to right shunting and a high-output state. Management for this pathology includes but is not limited to the use of percutaneous coiling, implantation of covered stents, graft removal and regrafting, and ligation. TEXT: Background In 1951, Vineberg first reported the use of the internal mammary artery to revascularize the cardiac muscle by directly implanting it to the myocardium [1]. In 1958, the first coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with internal mammary artery was performed by Longmire [1]. Typical complications from a CABG included stroke, vein graft occlusion, acute myocardial infarction, angina, damage to the aorta, bleeding, and death [2]. Iatrogenic aortocoronary arteriovenous fistula (ACAVF) due to unintentional grafting of a vessel to a coronary sinus is an extremely rare complication of CABG [2\\\\u20134]. ACAVF patients can present with angina, dyspnea, fatigue, ventricular arrhythmia, or heart failure [1]. These patients need to be monitored for symptoms or new-onset continuous murmurs [1]. Most patients experience symptoms between 6 weeks and 4 years after their CABG [1]. Symptom presentation can be delayed especially in patients with small ACAVF [1].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Fatigue, Dyspnoea, Cardiac failure, Oedema peripheral, Asthenia, Cardiac failure congestive, Ventricular arrhythmia, Dyspnoea exertional, Ventricular tachycardia, Angina pectoris, Peripheral swelling, Cardiac arrest, Ventricular fibrillation, Arrhythmia, Cardiac failure acute, Malaise, Oedema, Mental fatigue, Prinzmetal angina, Cardiac failure high output, Tachypnoea, Lethargy, Respiratory distress, Right ventricular failure, Dyspnoea at rest, Cardiac failure chronic, Congestive cardiomyopathy, Coronary artery disease, Ventricular failure, Cardiac dysfunction, Decreased appetite, Nocturnal dyspnoea, Acute coronary syndrome, Angina unstable, Muscle fatigue, Chest pain, Condition aggravated, Irregular breathing, Rhythm idioventricular, Left ventricular dysfunction, Left ventricular failure, Hypoxia, Ventricular flutter, Dyspnoea paroxysmal nocturnal, Orthopnoea, General physical health deterioration, Pulmonary oedema, Ventricular tachyarrhythmia, Cardiomegaly, Torsade de pointes\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
