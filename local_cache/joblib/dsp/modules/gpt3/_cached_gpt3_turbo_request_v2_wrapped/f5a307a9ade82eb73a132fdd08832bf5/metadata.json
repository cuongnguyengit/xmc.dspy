ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Neonatal thalamic hemorrhage is a strong risk factor for developing encephalopathy with continuous spikes and waves during sleep (ECSWS), even when not accompanied by widespread cortical destruction. The efficacy and indication of resective epilepsy surgery in such patients has not yet been reported. A 4-year-old boy was diagnosed with ECSWS based on strong epileptiform activation during sleep and neurocognitive deterioration. He had a history of left thalamic hemorrhage related to a straight sinus thrombosis during the newborn period. He presented with daily absence seizures that were refractory to medical treatment. At age 5, he underwent intracranial electroencephalogram (EEG) recording using depth and subdural strip electrodes placed in the left thalamus and over bilateral cortex, respectively. Interictal and ictal epileptiform discharges were observed in the thalamus, always preceded by discharges in the left or right parietal lobe. Left hemispherotomy successfully normalized the EEG of his unaffected hemisphere and extinguished his seizures. This is the first case report documenting resective epilepsy surgery in a patient with ECSWS due to neonatal thalamic injury without widespread cerebral destruction. Based on intracranial EEG findings, his injured thalamus did not directly generate the EEG abnormalities or absence seizures on its own. Patients with ipsilateral neonatal thalamic injury and even mild lateralized cortical changes may be candidates for resective or disconnective surgery for ECSWS. TEXT: 1. Introduction Encephalopathy with continuous spikes and waves during sleep (ECSWS) is an age-dependent epileptic encephalopathy that develops during childhood [1,2,3]. ECSWS is characterized by an electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern with strong activation of epileptiform activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep [4]. Clinical symptoms are variable; most children develop epileptic seizures and can present with variable deterioration in cognitive, language, behavioral, and/or motor aspects during development [1,2]. The etiology, clinical expression, effective treatment, and prognosis have not been fully clarified [1,2]. Moreover, no consensus has been reached regarding the terminology related to the name of the syndrome, concepts, and diagnostic criteria [5].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Seizure, Electroencephalogram, Epilepsy, Transverse sinus thrombosis, Cerebral haemorrhage neonatal, Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, Generalised tonic-clonic seizure, Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, Periventricular haemorrhage neonatal, Cerebral haemorrhage, Thalamus haemorrhage, Intraventricular haemorrhage neonatal, Stereotactic electroencephalography, Intraventricular haemorrhage, Subarachnoid haemorrhage neonatal, Atonic seizures, Seizure like phenomena, Cavernous sinus thrombosis, Status epilepticus, Thrombocytopenia, Cerebral venous thrombosis, Jugular vein thrombosis, Petit mal epilepsy, Subdural haemorrhage neonatal, Brachiocephalic vein thrombosis, Electroneurography, Electroneuromyography, Leukopenia, Haemorrhage intracranial, Deep vein thrombosis, Electrocorticogram, Cerebral haemorrhage foetal, Uncinate fits, Epileptic encephalopathy, Transcranial electrical motor evoked potential monitoring, Change in seizure presentation, Epileptic aura, Gelastic seizure, Echoencephalogram, Basal ganglia haemorrhage, Partial seizures, Convulsions local, Seizure cluster, Electronystagmogram, Tonic convulsion, Electromyogram, Haemorrhage neonatal, Automatism epileptic, Generalised onset non-motor seizure, Idiopathic generalised epilepsy\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653949.588267}
