The vacancy mentions a degree in \\\\\"Production Mechanical Electrical Marine Engineering (or similar)\\\\\" and the candidate might be \\\\\"newly educated.\\\\\" This suggests that the job requires a foundational understanding of engineering principles, particularly in the fields mentioned. Since the candidate might be newly educated, we can infer that the job may not require extensive experience but rather a solid educational background in the relevant engineering disciplines. We should look for skills that are related to mechanical, electrical, and marine engineering, as well as general engineering competencies that a recent graduate might possess.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: marine engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, operate mechanical equipment of ships, manage ship electrical systems, operate ship equipment, maintain shipboard machinery, maritime transportation technology, offshore constructions and facilities, provide support in vessel machinery systems\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: SQL experience is a plus but not required\\\\n\\\\nOptions: SQL, SQL Server, database, MySQL, use databases, PostgreSQL, Oracle Relational Database, data warehouse, database management systems, use query languages, query languages, manage database, Microsoft Access, operate relational database management system, database development tools, maintain database, data analytics, Teradata Database, CA Datacom/DB, business intelligence, Solidity, SPARQL, search databases, database quality standards, perform data mining, perform records management, data models, data mining, Drupal, maintain database performance, create data models, NoSQL, create database diagrams, manage quantitative data, implement data warehousing techniques, develop data processing applications, PHP, accounting, C#, design database scheme, SAP Data Services, DB2, use logic programming, manage data, data storage, balance database resources, SAS Data Management, perform data analysis, use accounting systems, use data processing techniques\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as beneficial for the job vacancy. The vacancy mentions \\\\\"SQL experience is a plus but not required,\\\\\" which suggests that while SQL skills are advantageous, they are not a mandatory requirement for the job. Therefore, we should focus on skills related to SQL and databases, as these are the most relevant to the statement provided.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: Skills: SQL, use databases, use query languages, query languages, manage database, database management systems, operate relational database management system, maintain database, create data models, manage data\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: Specifically Compensation and Performance Management .\\\\n\\\\nOptions: personnel management, calculate compensation payments, results-based management, cost management, advise on personnel management, human resource management, manage personnel, determine salaries, financial management, demand excellence from performers, manage payroll, provide performance feedback, optimise financial performance, manage profitability, conduct performance tests, manage human resources, promote equal pay, control of expenses, develop employee retention programs, manage staff, management department processes, calculate employee benefits, develop performance orientation in public administration, motivate employees, evaluate performance of organisational collaborators, evaluate employees, support managers, commission evaluation, manage operational budgets, provide operational efficiency training to employees, manage financial aspects of a company, provide feedback on job performance, supplier management, coach staff for running the performance, human resources department processes, communicate performance aspects, track key performance indicators, allocate paychecks, control financial resources, lead managers of company departments, meet productivity targets, evaluate employees work, provide improvement strategies, develop staff, business management principles, organisational policies, risk management, protect employee rights, evaluation of psychological performance, provide education management support\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed in the job vacancy snippet.
