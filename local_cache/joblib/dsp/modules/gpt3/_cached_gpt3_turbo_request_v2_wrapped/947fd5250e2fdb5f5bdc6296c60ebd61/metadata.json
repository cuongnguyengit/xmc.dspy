ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Children are more exposed to inappropriate medicine use and its consequent harms. Spontaneous reporting of suspected Serious Adverse Drug Reactions (SADR) increases knowledge and prevention of pharmacotherapy risk. Disproportionality measures are useful to quantify unexpected safety issues associated with a given drug-event pair (signals of disproportionality). This cross-sectional study aimed to assess SADR reporting and safety signals for Brazilian children from 0-12 years old, notified between January 2008 and December 2013 from the Brazilian Surveillance Agency (Notivisa). Information from serious reports (gender and age of the patient, event description, suspected drug) was included. Disproportionality analysis based on Reporting Odds Ratios with a confidence interval of 95% was conducted to identify possible signals of disproportionate reporting (SDR). Almost 30% of 1,977 suspected SADR was related to babies (0-1-year-old). 69% of reports happened with intravenous dosage forms, and 35% of suspected SADR involved off label use according to age. Laronidase, miglustat, imipenem/cilastatin, and clofarabine were involved in six or more suspected deaths among 75 deaths reported. There were 107 SDRs, of which 16 events (15%) were not described in the product labels. There was a relatively higher number of SADRs in Brazilian children compared with studies from other countries. SDRs found, (especially drug-event pairs \\'imipenen/cilastatin-pneumonia\\' and \\'laronidase-respiratory insufficiency\\') should be investigated more. The reports of SADR with IV dosage forms and OL drug use suggest the need for drug research and the use of better dosage forms for children in Brazil. TEXT: Introduction Ensuring safety, efficacy, and quality of medicines for the pediatric population is a challenge because data on many medicines are scarce due to the lack of clinical trials involving children (Joseph et al., 2015). As a result, children may be exposed to age-inappropriate medicines that can lead to increased incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) (Bellis et al., 2014). Risk factors associated with ADRs in children include polypharmacy, age, off-label (OL) use, and unlicensed (UL) use (Bellis et al., 2014; Lombardi et al., 2018). Reports of ADRs screening from surveillance systems may offer information about a different drug\\\\u2010event combination (or pairs) by the mining of a large volume of data (Harpaz et al., 2012). Such safety signals\\\\u2014a potentially causal association or a new aspect of a known association between an intervention and a set of related events\\\\u2014may be critical for drug regulation and improvements in child health (CIOMS, 2010; Osokogu et al., 2016).\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Pneumonia, Respiratory failure, Pneumonitis, Respiratory distress, Lung consolidation, Organising pneumonia, Hypoventilation, Respiratory arrest, Acute respiratory failure, Respiratory depression, Pneumonia bacterial, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, Dyspnoea, Hypotension, Parasitic pneumonia, Cardiac arrest, Interstitial lung disease, Cardiopulmonary failure, Acute kidney injury, Pneumonia viral, Hypoxia, Pneumonia fungal, Pneumonia aspiration, Maximal voluntary ventilation decreased, Lower respiratory tract infection, Renal failure, Central-alveolar hypoventilation, Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, Lower respiratory tract inflammation, Eosinophilic pneumonia, Respiratory paralysis, Respiratory rate decreased, Atypical pneumonia, Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Post procedural pneumonia, Pneumonia measles, Pneumonia influenzal, Lung infiltration, Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, Pneumonia herpes viral, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Respiratory muscle weakness, Alveolitis, Chronic respiratory failure, Neonatal pneumonia, Respiratory acidosis, Miliary pneumonia, Cardio-respiratory arrest, Pneumonia legionella, Pulmonary function test decreased\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

The article discusses serious adverse drug reactions (SADRs) in Brazilian children and mentions specific drug-event pairs such as \\'imipenem/cilastatin-pneumonia\\' and \\'laronidase-respiratory insufficiency\\'. These pairs are examples of safety signals that were identified through disproportionality analysis. The article also mentions that there were 16 events not described in the product labels, but it does not specify what those events are.
