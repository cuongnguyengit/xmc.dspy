ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Electrophysiologic findings in patients with COVID-19 and quadriparesia in the northwest of Iran, A case series study and literature review. ABSTRACT: As a global health pandemic, the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV2) outbreak began in December 2019 which rapidly spread to more than 200 countries. Respiratory complications and fever are the most obvious symptoms. Sometimes the neurological features are superimposed on the main disease and complicate patient\\'s status. We describe 6 patients with COVID-19 and concomitant quadriparesia who underwent electrodiagnosis using EMG/NCS and results indicated 3 axonal variants of Guillain-Barr\\\\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), including; 2 cases AMAN (acute motor axonal neuropathy), 1 case AMSAN (acute motor and sensory axonal neuropathy), three myopathies, including one combination of CIN/CIM (critical illness neuropathy/critical illness myopathy), one CIM and one acute polymyositis in these cases. Early diagnosis of the neuromuscular disorders of coronavirus could help for correct planning in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Since GBS and inflammatory myopathies have an autoimmune basis, the immunotherapies such as IVIG, steroids, plasma exchange and other novel treatments as hemoperfusion can promise better and faster recovery in respiratory function and neuromuscular activity among COVID-19 patients who have musculature paralysis concomitantly. However, all these treatments are challenging and further clinical trials should be done to confirm the efficacy and safety of mentioned therapies. TEXT: pmcThe novel coronavirus, causing severe acute respiratory syndrome- coronavirus 2 (SARS- CoV2), emerged in Wuhan City, China, on the late December 2019 which drew significant attention and effort as a global health concern (1). World Health Organization (WHO) named it coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) and declared it as pandemic on March 11, 2020 (2). On October 10th 2020, approximately 45 million cases of COVID-19 were reported, including 1,189,499 death (3). In addition to respiratory tract infection symptoms, neuromuscular, and nervous system involvement are more recently identified as presentations of this disease (4). Patients with more severe infections have common co-morbidities, and tend to present more atypical symptoms, including neurological and skeletal muscle injury manifestations (5).\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Haemorrhage, Myopathy, Myositis, Immunosuppression, Neuropathy peripheral, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Muscle disorder, Acute motor axonal neuropathy, Acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy, Immunomodulatory therapy, Epistaxis, Polymyositis, Immunochemotherapy, Rhabdomyolysis, Myalgia, Extravasation blood, Condition aggravated, Immune enhancement therapy, Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Myositis-like syndrome, Neuromyopathy, Immune-mediated myositis, Autoimmune myositis, Haemoptysis, Plasmapheresis, Steroid activity, Immunoadsorption therapy, Exchange blood transfusion, Immunoglobulin therapy, Blood urine, Infective myositis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Dermatomyositis, Axonal neuropathy, Apheresis, Focal myositis, Plateletpheresis, Internal haemorrhage, Acute kidney injury, Disease progression, Myocarditis, Bloody discharge, Haematochezia, Transfusion, Steroid therapy, Polyneuropathy, Blood loss anaemia, Cerebral haemorrhage, Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Immune disorder prophylaxis\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706654014.153844}
