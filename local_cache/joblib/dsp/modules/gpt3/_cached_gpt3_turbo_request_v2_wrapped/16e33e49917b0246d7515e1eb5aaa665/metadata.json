ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Metformin with neoadjuvant chemoradiation to improve pathologic response in rectal cancer: A pilot phase I/II trial. ABSTRACT: Neoadjuvant radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy decreases the risk of local recurrence after surgery for rectal cancer. Emerging data suggest that diabetic patients on metformin may have improved cancer outcome after radiotherapy. A single institutional pilot study was performed to determine if metformin given concurrently with long course chemoradiation (CRT) may improve pathologic complete response (pCR) in non-diabetic rectal cancer patients. The study was designed to construct a confidence interval (CI) for the pCR rate to determine the sample size for a phase 2 trial. Non-diabetic patients with biopsy confirmed rectal cancer deemed candidates for long course neoadjuvant CRT were invited to participate. Radiation consisted of 50.4 Gy in 28 daily fractions with concurrent daily capecitabine (825 mg/m2 twice daily). Participants self-administered metformin (500 mg of twice daily) 2 weeks prior to, during and for 4 weeks after CRT. A total of 16 patients were accrued. One patient withdrew from the study. Only grade 1 or 2 adverse events were observed. Three patients had a clinical complete response (cCR) and did not undergo surgery. Of the 12 patients who underwent surgery, there were two pCRs. For the combined pCR/cCR rate of 33% (95% CI 19-47%), a total of 85 patients will be required to yield a 95% CI with a 10% margin of error. Adding metformin to neoadjuvant CRT for rectal cancer does not appear to enhance toxicities. These results will be used to refine the design and conduct of a future phase 2 trial to determine whether adding metformin to CRT improves pCR/cCR rates. TEXT: Introduction Pre-operative or neoadjuvant radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy decreases the risk of local recurrence after surgery for rectal cancer, and is currently considered standard therapy for patients with stage II or III rectal cancer [1]. For patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, optimizing the neoadjuvant therapy may further improve locoregional control. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation (CRT) results in 15\\\\u201325% pathological complete response (pCR) rates. Patients with a pCR may not benefit from definitive surgical resection [2], [3]. Thus, improving CR rates has the potential to also spare a significant number of patients from the morbidity of surgery including the need for a permanent stoma or low anterior resection syndrome.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Rectal cancer, Radiotherapy, Drug ineffective, Disease progression, Rectosigmoid cancer, Brachytherapy, Treatment failure, Rectal adenocarcinoma, Gamma radiation therapy, Colorectal cancer, Malignant anorectal neoplasm, Photon radiation therapy, Rectal cancer metastatic, Radiosensitisation therapy, Metastases to rectum, Rectal cancer stage I, Rectal cancer stage 0, Therapy partial responder, Rectal cancer recurrent, Radiation castration, Rectal cancer stage II, Rectal cancer stage III, Rectal cancer stage IV, Anal cancer, Radioembolisation, Therapeutic response decreased, Radiocastration procedure, Rectosigmoid cancer metastatic, Rectal neoplasm, Brachytherapy to soft tissue, Rectosigmoid cancer stage 0, Rectosigmoid cancer stage I, Remission not achieved, Colorectal adenocarcinoma, Radiotherapy toxicity attenuation, Radiotherapy to head and neck, Colon cancer, Radiation injury, Brachytherapy to skin, Rectosigmoid cancer stage III, Rectosigmoid cancer stage II, Brachytherapy to blood, Radiotherapy to soft tissue, Therapy non-responder, Brachytherapy to ear nose or throat, Rectosigmoid cancer recurrent, Rectosigmoid cancer stage IV, Radiotherapy to gastrointestinal tract, Neoadjuvant therapy, Chemotherapy toxicity attenuation\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653901.3346465}
