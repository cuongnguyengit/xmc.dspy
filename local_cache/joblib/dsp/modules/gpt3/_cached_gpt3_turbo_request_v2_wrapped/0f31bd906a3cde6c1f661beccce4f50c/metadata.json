ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\\\\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: Pneumonitis is a potential consequence of both lung-directed radiation and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), particularly treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Significant morbidity and mortality can result, and severe pneumonitis attributed to ICB precludes continued therapy. Thus, discriminating between radiation- and ICB- related pneumonitis is of importance for the increasing number of patients receiving both treatments. Furthermore, data are limited regarding the interplay between radiation- and ICB-induced lung injury, and which biomarkers might be associated with toxicity. We report longitudinal clinical and radiologic data, and circulating biomarkers in a melanoma patient treated with axillary radiation followed by ICB who developed consolidation and ground glass opacities (GGO) within the radiation field suggestive of radiation-pneumonitis followed by consolidation outside of the radiation field suggestive of ICB-related pneumonitis. Of note, symptomatic radiation-pneumonitis developed despite a low radiation dose to the lung (V20 < 8%), and ICB-related pneumonitis was limited to the ipsilateral lung, suggesting additive effect of radiation and ICB in the development of lung injury. Circulating biomarker analyses demonstrated increases in CXCR2, IL1ra and IL2ra that coincided with the development of symptomatic pneumonitis. These data highlight the imaging findings associated with radiation and ICB-related lung toxicity, and anecdotally describe a clinical course with circulating biomarker correlates. This information can help guide clinical evaluation and future research investigations into the toxicity of combined radiation immunotherapy approaches. TEXT: Background Pneumonitis develops in less than 5% of patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor ICB monotherapy. [1, 2] Many cases are relatively mild, and patients can resume ICB therapy following steroid treatment and resolution of symptoms. However, < 1% of cases are more severe [1], and patients can require prolonged treatment, require hospitalization, and be precluded from additional ICB treatment, even if this therapy is otherwise providing clinical benefit. In addition to ICB, radiation therapy to the lung can also lead to an inflammatory pneumonitis generally treated with a lengthy course of corticosteroids in more severe cases. Rates of radiation pneumonitis vary significantly based on the amount of lung irradiated, as well as the dose of radiation that is delivered [3]. For example, in lung cancer patients, rates of grade 2 or higher pneumonitis were found to be 0% when the volume of the lung receiving 20 Gray (Gy) or higher was less than 22%, as compared to a 42% risk if the volume receiving 20 Gy or higher was greater than 40%.
