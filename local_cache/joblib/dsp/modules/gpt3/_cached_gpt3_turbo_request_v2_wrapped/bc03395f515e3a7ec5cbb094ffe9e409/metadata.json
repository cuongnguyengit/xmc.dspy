ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \\\\\"found down\\\\\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \\\\u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \\\\u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\\\\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\\\\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \\\\u201ccatch up\\\\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Insomnia, Compartment syndrome, Crush syndrome, Somnolence, Acute kidney injury, Fatigue, Sleep disorder, Sleep deficit, Poor quality sleep, Sleep inertia, Sleep terror, Irregular sleep phase, Behavioural induced insufficient sleep syndrome, Middle insomnia, Parasomnia, Dyssomnia, Terminal insomnia, Abnormal sleep-related event, Abdominal compartment syndrome, Delayed sleep phase, Psychophysiologic insomnia, Paradoxical insomnia, Advanced sleep phase, Somnambulism, Crush injury, Sleep attacks, Sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, Hyposomnia, Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, Orbital compartment syndrome, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition insomnia type, Condition aggravated, Initial insomnia, Irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition parasomnia type, Hypersomnia, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition mixed type, Myalgia, Bedridden, Behavioural insomnia of childhood, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition hypersomnia type, Decompression sickness, Breathing-related sleep disorder, Loss of dreaming, Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Rapid eye movements sleep abnormal, Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Lethargy, Crushing injury of trunk, Sudden onset of sleep\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis is an interstitial pneumonia caused by an immunological reaction to the chronic inhalation of an antigen. Little is known, however, about the pathological change of the pulmonary lesions. A 33-year-old man was diagnosed with chronic bird-related hypersensitivity pneumonitis based on the findings of a surgical lung biopsy and an inhalation provocation test. He underwent lung transplantation at 8 years after the diagnosis because of disease progression. We conclude that the analysis of the explant suggests that the presence of extensive fibrosis in the centrilobular and perilobular area with bridging fibrosis is a form of pathological progression of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. TEXT: Introduction Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an interstitial pneumonia caused by an immunological reaction to an inhaled antigen. Clinically, HP is divided into acute and chronic forms. In chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP), the fibrotic process progresses for more than 6 months (1). The precise diagnosis of CHP is always difficult because radiologic data and other clinical findings mimic the clinical picture of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) (2, 3). Pathological findings from surgical lung biopsy (SLB) and autopsy are therefore important for exploring the diagnosis. In the pathological observation of SLB, chronic bronchiolitis with granulomatous inflammation and bronchiolocentric distribution, in addition to perilobular fibrosis, is suggestive of CHP rather than IIPs (4). Autopsy findings also shed light on the progression of fibrosis caused by CHP (5, 6). Although the autopsy lung findings reveal the progression of CHP, the effects of terminal events, such as bacterial and fungal infection or diffuse alveolar damage are superimposed on those specimens. We hereby describe a case of CHP that was treated with lung transplantation. The specimens obtained from the explanted lung revealed how the pathological changes progressed over an 8-year period.
