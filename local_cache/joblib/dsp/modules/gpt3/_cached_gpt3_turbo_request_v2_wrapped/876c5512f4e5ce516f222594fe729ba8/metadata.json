ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\\\\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: A 73-year-old man with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) was being treated with hydroxyurea, which was changed to ruxolitinib treatment because of worsening constitutional symptoms. Although ruxolitinib rapidly induced relief, he developed a high-grade fever. A comprehensive fever work-up found no apparent cause of the fever, except for PMF. Therefore, we increased the dose of ruxolitinib and added prednisolone, which was gradually withdrawn with resolution of the fever. However, the patient subsequently developed disseminated tuberculosis and died eight months after initiation of ruxolitinib. Our case highlights the importance of assessing and monitoring the immune status of patients receiving ruxolitinib. TEXT: Introduction Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder resulting from mutations that include the JAK-STAT signaling regulator genes and/or epigenetic regulator genes (1). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only treatment with curative potential for PMF, with other treatment options being palliative and focused on alleviating the constitutional symptoms. Ruxolitinib, a selective inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2, significantly reduces splenomegaly and relieves constitutional symptoms, which results in an improved quality of life for patients with PMF (2). Although ruxolitinib is a promising and active treatment option, several recent case reports have suggested that patients treated with ruxolitinib might be at risk for various opportunistic infections, including reactivation of tuberculosis (3). However, because of a lack of evidence, there are no criteria for identifying those high-risk patients being treated with ruxolitinib who should be considered for prophylaxis/treatment. We herein report a patient with PMF who developed fatal disseminated tuberculosis during treatment with ruxolitinib plus prednisolone. Case Report A 73-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of marked splenomegaly (6 cm below the costal margin), thrombocytosis, and an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level in April 2013. A bone marrow biopsy showed grade 3 fibrosis with the JAK2 V617F mutation. He was diagnosed with PMF with an intermediate-2 risk score by the Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System (DIPSS) Plus (4). Because ruxolitinib was not available in Japan at the time, he first received hydroxyurea (HU; 500 mg daily) to alleviate abdominal distension due to splenomegaly, which partially improved soon after the initiation of HU. However, his constitutional symptoms, including anemia, a low-grade fever, night sweats, and abdominal distention (splenomegaly 10 cm below the costal margin), worsened two years after starting HU.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Tuberculosis, Pulmonary tuberculosis, Extrapulmonary tuberculosis, Disseminated tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex test positive, Latent tuberculosis, Cutaneous tuberculosis, Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome associated tuberculosis, Mycobacterial infection, Pulmonary tuberculoma, Bovine tuberculosis, Bone tuberculosis, Tuberculosis of genitourinary system, Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex test, Tuberculosis gastrointestinal, Female genital tract tuberculosis, Intestinal tuberculosis, Male genital tract tuberculosis, Tuberculin test positive, Tuberculid, Tuberculosis of eye, Tuberculous pleurisy, Tuberculosis immunisation, Superinfection mycobacterial, Tuberculosis of central nervous system, Mycobacterium abscessus infection, Joint tuberculosis, Mammary tuberculosis, Mycobacterium test positive, Lymph node tuberculosis, Oral tuberculosis, Renal tuberculosis, Tuberculosis bladder, Ear tuberculosis, Meningitis tuberculous, Pericarditis tuberculous, False positive tuberculosis test, Atypical mycobacterium test positive, Atypical mycobacterial infection, Tuberculous tenosynovitis, Peritoneal tuberculosis, Adrenal gland tuberculosis, Conjunctivitis tuberculous, Drug ineffective, Tuberculous laryngitis, Mycobacterium kansasii infection, Mycobacterial disease carrier, Mycobacterium avium complex infection, Tuberculosis of intrathoracic lymph nodes, Choroid tubercles\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653418.2371542}
