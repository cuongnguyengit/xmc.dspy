ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Increased multiple sclerosis disease activity in patients transitioned from fingolimod to dimethyl fumarate: a case series. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Fingolimod is a S1P1 receptor modulator that prevents activated lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues causing lymphopenia, mainly affecting CD4+ T lymphocytes. Withdrawal from fingolimod can be followed by severe disease reactivation, and this coincides with return of autoreactive lymphocytes into circulation. The CD8+ T cytotoxic population returns prior to the regulatory CD4+ T lymphocytes leading to a state of dysregulation, which may contribute to the rebound and severity of clinical relapses. On the other hand, dimethyl fumarate (DMF) preferentially reduces CD8+ T lymphocytes, has the same efficacy as fingolimod, and therefore, was expected to be a suitable oral alternative to reduce the rebound associated with fingolimod withdrawal. METHODS We present six patients with relapsing-remitting MS who developed an unexpected increase in disease activity after transitioning from fingolimod to DMF. All patients were clinically and radiologically stable on fingolimod for at least 1 year. The switch in therapy was due to significantly low CD4+ T lymphocyte count \\\\u226465 cells/ul (normal range 490-1740 cells/ul), after discussing the results with the patients and the potential risk for opportunistic infections including cryptococcal infections. DMF was introduced following a washout period of 5 to 11 weeks to allow reconstitution of the immune system and for the absolute lymphocyte count to reach \\\\u2265500 cells/ul. Every patient who experienced a relapse had several enhancing lesions in the brain and/or spinal cord between 12 to 23 weeks after cessation of fingolimod and 1 to 18 weeks after starting DMF. All relapses were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone with good clinical responses. CONCLUSIONS The anticipated beneficial response of DMF treatment to mitigate rebound after fingolimod therapy cessation was not observed. Our patients experienced rebound disease despite being on treatment with DMF. Additional studies are necessary to understand which treatments are most effective to transition to after discontinuing fingolimod.
