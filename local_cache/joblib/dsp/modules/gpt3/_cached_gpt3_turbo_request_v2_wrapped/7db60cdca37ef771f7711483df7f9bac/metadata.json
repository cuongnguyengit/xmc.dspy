ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), presenting as immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS), is a known complication of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people living with HIV (PLWH). Typically preceded by ART initiation, IRIS may appear simultaneously/unmasked (PML-s-IRIS) or as a delayed/worsening/paradoxical (PML-d-IRIS) presentation of known PML disease. Primary cerebellar tropism continues to be a rare presentation, and paradoxical cerebellar involvement of PML-IRIS syndrome can be a challenge for both diagnosis and management. Steroids have been suggested as a possible therapy in severe cases but the duration of steroid therapy remain elusive. Our case is that of a 34-year-old man with newly diagnosed HIV simultaneously found to have cerebellar PML. His PML lesions however worsened after initiation of ART (PML-d-IRIS) with evidence of increased intracranial pressure. Despite initial favorable response to a short duration of steroids, he had multiple recurrence of his PML lesions after steroids were discontinued. The presence of predominant cerebellar lesions and the question of how long steroids should be provided to prevent or minimize PML recurrence is the highlight of our case. This report emphasizes the need for more controlled studies to assist clinicians in the optimal diagnosis and management of PML-IRIS in PLWH. TEXT: 1. Introduction Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a debilitating complication of infection by John Cunningham virus (JCV) culminating in an often-fatal demyelinating central nervous system (CNS) disease [1]. Incidence among the general population remains 0.22 per 100,000 despite widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) [2]. Notwithstanding the recent epidemiological shift of PML afflicting mostly patients with profound immunosuppression [3], such as those on immunotherapies or monoclonal antibody treatments [4], people living with HIV (PLWH) remain an important subgroup for PML incidence. This is particularly relevant when the CD4+ lymphocyte count is <200 cells/\\\\u03bcL [5]. While JCV tropism for the cerebellum is more common among HIV-PML, only few case reports detail the paradoxical type of PML-IRIS (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome), particularly those involving the infratentorial lesions which are at higher risk for clinical deterioration [3]. The present case report examines the clinical and radiological progression of IRIS with recurrent paradoxical cerebellar HIV-associated PML and a brief literature review. 2.
