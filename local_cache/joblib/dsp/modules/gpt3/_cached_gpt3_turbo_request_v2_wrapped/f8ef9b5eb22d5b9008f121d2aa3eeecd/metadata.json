ABSTRACT: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon and life-threating condition characterized by major immune activation and massive cytokine production by mononuclear inflammatory cells, due to defects in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. It is even more unusual in renal transplant recipients, in which it is often associated with uncontrolled infection. The mortality is high in HLH and differential diagnosis with sepsis is a challenge. The approach and management depend on the underlying trigger and comorbidities. We report a case of a 50-year-old renal transplant female admitted with fever and malaise 3 months post-transplant and presenting anemia, fever, hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of serum ferritin, and positive CMV antigenemia. Urine was positive for decoy cells and BKV-DNA. Graft biopsy showed CMV nephritis. Both blood and urine cultures where positive for E. coli. Hemophagocytosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone, with complete response after 3 weeks. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of a rare and serious condition in a renal transplant patient, which can allow a favorable clinical course and improve survival rate. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) consists of an immune hyperactivation syndrome that takes place when NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to eliminate activated macrophages, leading to over production of proinflammatory cytokines1. There are primary and acquired causes. Primary HLH is rare and typically manifests in childhood because of two autosomal recessive defects in genes that encode proteins involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules during apoptosis in natural killer (NK) cells.1 , 2Acquired (secondary) HLH is triggered by various conditions as infections, immunodeficiency, rheumatologic diseases, and cancer.1 , 3 , 4 Infection is the most common precipitating factor of HLH in adults, mainly viruses of herpes family (EBV, CMV, HSV, HHV8), but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens can also be a trigger.5 , 6 Multiorgan involvement and organomegaly are frequently found and hemophagocytosis results in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of HLH is based on the presence of at least 5 of the following 8 criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting \\\\u2265 2 lineages of peripheral blood cells), hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, serum ferritin >500 ng/mL, low activity of NK cells, soluble CD25 > 2.400 U/mL and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes.7 Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red cells, platelets, or white cells in macrophage cytoplasm visualized in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.2 The syndrome is defined by a complex picture. However, some patients may have incipient or partial disease.1 Most diagnostic\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Neutropenia, Pancytopenia, Infection, Thrombocytopenia, Cytomegalovirus infection, Febrile neutropenia, Bone marrow failure, Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Leukopenia, Hypertriglyceridaemia, Anaemia, Cytopenia, Fungal infection, Hyperglycaemia, Apoptosis, Bacterial infection, Herpes simplex, Agranulocytosis, Sepsis, Hyperlipidaemia, Granulocytopenia, Hypercholesterolaemia, Condition aggravated, Blood triglycerides increased, Platelet count decreased, Hyper HDL cholesterolaemia, Aplastic anaemia, Herpes virus infection, Pyrexia, Cell death, Herpes simplex hepatitis, Cytomegalovirus viraemia, Familial hypertriglyceridaemia, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Cytomegalovirus infection reactivation, Immune-mediated pancytopenia, Disease progression, Familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Type III hyperlipidaemia, Acquired mixed hyperlipidaemia, Varicella, Type I hyperlipidaemia, Autoimmune pancytopenia, Type II hyperlipidaemia, Infection parasitic, Type V hyperlipidaemia, Blood cholesterol increased, Lipids increased, Type IV hyperlipidaemia, Plasmablast count decreased\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: Hodgkin\\'s disease is recognized as part of the spectrum of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), although it is still an uncommon de novo malignancy in this population. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been linked to both post-transplant non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphomas and Hodgkin\\'s disease. We report a case of recurrent Hodgkin\\'s disease in a patient who received a renal transplant in childhood and later developed EBV-associated Hodgkin\\'s disease with remission after chemotherapy until subsequent relapse 9 years later that was successfully treated. To our knowledge, this is the first report of recurrent Hodgkin\\'s disease in a transplant recipient. We briefly discuss the pathogenesis of and risk factors for EBV-related PTLD, utility of EBV load surveillance, and the options for treatment of PTLD including immunosuppression reduction, antiviral therapy, anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, cytotoxic T cells, and the possible roles of interferon-alpha and rapamycin. TEXT: Case report The patient is a 27-year-old white man who received a living-related donor transplant from his father at 11 years of age in 1986 for end stage renal disease secondary to posterior urethral valves. The patient was seronegative for cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein\\\\u2013Barr virus (EBV) prior to transplantation. His father\\'s EBV and CMV status were unavailable. The transplant course was complicated by immediate postoperative acute renal artery thrombosis, which required transplant nephrectomy. He then received a deceased donor renal transplant 10 days later. Maintenance immunosuppression consisted of cyclosporine (Sandimmune formulation), azathioprine, and prednisone. He received 12 doses of Minnesota equine antilymphocyte immunoglobulin (MALG) for induction followed by 10 doses of murine anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (OKT3) for two episodes of acute graft rejection over the 7 weeks following the transplant. The deceased donor\\'s EBV and CMV status were unavailable from medical records. The patient developed acute infectious mononucleosis 2 months after transplantation demonstrated by positive EBV serology. He was treated with acyclovir and the infectious mononucleosis resolved. At the age of 18, he presented with 5 months of fever, weight-loss and night sweats, and was found to have axillary adenopathy, splenomegaly and bulky right mediastinal adenopathy. A right anterior, thoracotomy and lymph node biopsy demonstrated Hodgkin\\'s disease, nodular sclerosing subtype. Hodgkin\\'s\\\\u2013Reed\\\\u2013Sternberg (HRS) cells were strongly positive for CD30 and EBV-latent membrane protein (LMP)-1. He was staged as Hodgkin\\'s disease-IIIB. His EBV serology demonstrated elevated antiviral capsid antigen (VCA) IgG titers and positive anti-VCA IgM, consistent with reactivation of EBV infection.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Post transplant lymphoproliferative disorder, Cytomegalovirus infection, Lymphoproliferative disorder, Hodgkin\\'s disease recurrent, Epstein-Barr virus infection, Disease progression, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type recurrent, Hodgkin\\'s disease mixed cellularity recurrent, Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphoproliferative disorder, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte depletion type recurrent, Lymphoproliferative disorder in remission, Hodgkin\\'s disease nodular sclerosis recurrent, Disease recurrence, Thrombocytopenia, High grade B-cell lymphoma Burkitt-like lymphoma recurrent, Epstein-Barr virus antibody, Graft versus host disease, B-cell lymphoma recurrent, Epstein-Barr virus associated lymphoma, Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome, Hodgkin\\'s disease refractory, Cytomegalovirus test, Cytomegalovirus viraemia, Chronic graft versus host disease, Cytomegalovirus infection reactivation, Cytomegalovirus hepatitis, Hodgkin\\'s disease lymphocyte predominance type refractory, Lymphoplasia, Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma recurrent, Cytomegalovirus mononucleosis, Cytomegalovirus syndrome, Epstein-Barr virus test, Precursor B-lymphoblastic lymphoma recurrent, Lymphoma transformation, Human polyomavirus infection, Hodgkin\\'s disease unclassifiable, Epstein-Barr viraemia, Neutralising antibodies, Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, Adult T-cell lymphoma/leukaemia recurrent, Hodgkin\\'s disease, Nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphoma, Epstein-Barr virus infection reactivation, Burkitt\\'s lymphoma recurrent, Epstein-Barr virus test positive, Cytomegalovirus enteritis, Hodgkin\\'s disease mixed cellularity refractory, Cytomegalovirus test positive, Acute graft versus host disease, Pulmonary nodular lymphoid hyperplasia\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653345.5671194}
