ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: The neuropharmacology of marijuana, including its effects on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)/antidepressant metabolism and the subsequent response and tolerability in youth, has received limited attention. We sought to (1) review clinically relevant pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) interactions between cannabinoids and selected SSRIs, (2) use PK models to examine the impact of cannabinoids on SSRI exposure (area under curve (AUC)) and maximum concentration (CMAX) in adolescents, and (3) examine the frequency of adverse events reported when SSRIs and cannabinoids are used concomitantly. Cannabinoid metabolism, interactions with SSRIs, impact on relevant PK/PD pathways and known drug-drug interactions were reviewed. Then, the impact of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) on exposure (AUC24) and CMAX for escitalopram and sertraline was modeled using pediatric PK data. Using data from the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS), the relationship between CBD and CYP2C19-metabolized SSRIs and side effects was examined. Cannabis and CBD inhibit cytochrome activity, alter serotonergic transmission, and modulate SSRI response. In PK models, CBD and/or THC increases sertraline and es/citalopram concentrations in adolescents, and coadministration of CBD and CYP2C19-metabolized SSRIs increases the risk of cough, diarrhea, dizziness, and fatigue. Given the significant SSRI-cannabinoid interactions, clinicians should discuss THC and CBD use in youth prescribed SSRIs and be aware of the impact of initiating, stopping, or decreasing cannabinoid use as this may significantly affect es/citalopram and sertraline exposure. TEXT: 1. Introduction Anxiety and depressive disorders, the most common mental health conditions in children and adolescents [1], are frequently treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) [2,3,4]. However, treatment response varies considerably [5,6,7,8] and is often difficult to predict [9]. The considerable variation in SSRI response in adolescents with depressive and anxiety disorders is complex and is related to multiple factors, including comorbidity, pharmacogenetics, and substance use [10,11,12]. Youth with depression are twice as likely to report cannabis use and use amongst depressed teens has increased more rapidly over the past 15 years compared to their peers [13]. Further, an estimated one in three twelfth graders (17\\\\u201318 years old) used marijuana in the past year and 6% of these adolescents used marijuana on a daily basis. Similarly, among eighth and tenth graders, daily use increased since 2018, with 1.3% of eighth graders (an 85.7% increase in 13\\\\u201314-year-olds) and 4.8% of tenth graders (a 41.2% increase in 15\\\\u201316-year-olds) reporting daily use (NIDA, NIH, NHHS).\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Diarrhoea, Fatigue, Dizziness, Cough, Asthenia, Off label use, Disease progression, Drug ineffective, Anxiety, Condition aggravated, Product use in unapproved indication, Constipation, Drug abuse, Product use issue, Productive cough, Drug interaction, Intentional product use issue, Substance use, Anxiety disorder, Depression, Vertigo, Malaise, Depressed mood, Intentional product misuse, Mental fatigue, Panic disorder, Generalised anxiety disorder, Vomiting, Drug resistance, Substance abuse, Lethargy, Illness anxiety disorder, Dizziness postural, Nausea, Persistent depressive disorder, Decreased appetite, Anxiety disorder due to a general medical condition, Drug use disorder, Depressive symptom, Muscle fatigue, Diarrhoea infectious, Habit cough, Confusional state, Panic reaction, Substance use disorder, Disorientation, Dyspnoea, Major depression, Substance abuser, General physical health deterioration\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
