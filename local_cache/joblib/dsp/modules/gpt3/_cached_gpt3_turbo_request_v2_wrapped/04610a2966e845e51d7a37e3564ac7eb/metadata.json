ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE Bilateral quadratus lumborum block has been described for major abdominal procedures when sepsis is present, because risks associated to epidural are considered elevated. In an open aortic surgery, a single-shot bilateral quadratus lumborum block type 1 may be an alternative to thoracic epidural block for post-operative analgesia in a patient having an increased cumulative risk for thoracic epidural hematoma. METHODS A 56-year-old female patient presenting controlled hypertension, chronic renal disease stage 3b, dyslipidemia and a platelet count of 102,000/\\\\u03bcl, and taking aspirin, was scheduled for bilateral aortoiliac endarterectomy. She was submitted to a sole general anesthesia plus, at end of the surgery, a bilateral quadratus lumborum block type 1 for post-operative analgesia with 20mL of ropivacaine 0.5%, per side, before extubation. Immediately after post anesthesia care unit admission, patient developed moderate hypotension (dopamine infusion was needed during 18h), concomitantly with a rapid reduction in the pain scores. Low numeric rating scale and opioid consumption were noted, particularly in the first 24h post-operatively. CONCLUSIONS Quadratus lumborum block was an effective analgesic technique for open aortic surgery in this case, although hypotension associated to bilateral quadratus lumborum block type 1 may occur. Associated sympathetic block probably related to the bilateral paravertebral extension of the block, may contribute for post-operative hypotension associated to reperfusion-ischemia syndrome in a patient that had long-lasting intraoperative aortic cross-clamping. The use of high concentration of local anesthetic to obtain longer duration of action of a single-shot quadratus lumborum block to avoid thoracic epidural or bilateral quadratus lumborum block catheterization should be used judiciously. TEXT: pmcIntroduction We describe a bilateral Quadratus Lumborum Block Type 1 (QLB1) for post-operative analgesia in an open aortic surgery case, as an alternative to thoracic epidural block in a patient presenting an increased cumulative risk for epidural hematoma. QLB1 blocks T6 to L1 dermatomes, at least, thus having the potential to cover the entire sensitive innervation of the abdominal wall and, differently from other TAP blocks; they also block visceral afferent pathways to the spinal cord, through the paravertebral extension of the blockade. These techniques may be very important in major abdominal vascular surgery in selected patients, but the risks associated to bilateral extension of the paravertebral blockade may exist. A written consent from the patient for publication was obtained.
