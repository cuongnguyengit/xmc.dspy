ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND TAFRO syndrome, which was first reported in 2010 in Japan, is a relatively rare disease characterized by thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, renal impairment, reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly. Although this disease is considered similar to multicentric Castleman disease, some of the clinical features, such as thrombocytopenia, are different from typical cases of multicentric Castleman disease. In addition, the etiology of TAFRO syndrome remains unknown and controversial. There have only been a few cases of TAFRO syndrome complicated with adrenal gland lesions, and all of them have had hemorrhagic involvement. METHODS This report describes the case of a 46-year-old Asian man who presented with fever, epigastric pain, and back pain for 1 month. A computed tomographic scan revealed ascites, mild lymphadenopathy, and left adrenal necrosis without hemorrhage. A blood test showed thrombocytopenia, anemia, and elevated C-reactive protein, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine levels. Based on the edema, severe thrombocytopenia, fever, reticulin myelofibrosis shown by bone marrow biopsy, mild lymphadenopathy, and progressive renal insufficiency, we diagnosed this patient as having TAFRO syndrome. He was successfully treated by immediate administration of glucocorticoids and tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS There have been no previous reports of a case of TAFRO syndrome complicated with adrenal necrosis. Because the biopsy of the left adrenal gland revealed necrosis without any evidence of hemorrhage, we concluded that the unilateral adrenal necrosis in this case was caused by either ischemia from infarction or organomegaly itself under severe hypercytokinemia. This unusual clinical course is useful for further analysis of the etiology of TAFRO syndrome. TEXT: Background TAFRO syndrome (thrombocytopenia, anasarca, fever, renal impairment or reticulin fibrosis, and organomegaly) was first reported by Takai et al. in 2010 [1], and several cases have since been reported, mainly in Japan, but also in other countries. At first, TAFRO syndrome was thought to be a subtype of human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)-negative idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD), but Iwaki et al. recently reported that the pathophysiology of TAFRO syndrome seemed to differ from that of iMCD [2]. Along with increasing case reports, the diagnosis criteria and treatment guidelines, as well as the concept of this disease, have been established gradually [2, 3]. In terms of organ damage, the kidneys are commonly involved, and temporal hemodialysis is required in some cases [2]. Notably, there have only been a few cases of TAFRO syndrome complicated with adrenal lesions, and all of them have had hemorrhagic involvement [4, 5]. No cases accompanied by adrenal gland necrosis without hemorrhage have yet been reported.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Thrombocytopenia, Anaemia, Pyrexia, Renal impairment, Acute kidney injury, Renal failure, Platelet count decreased, Anuria, Oliguria, Haemoglobin decreased, Febrile neutropenia, Pancytopenia, Body temperature increased, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Hyperpyrexia, Leukopenia, Bone marrow reticulin fibrosis, Immune thrombocytopenia, Deficiency anaemia, Thrombocytopenic purpura, Hyperthermia, Neutropenia, Blood creatinine increased, Microcytic anaemia, Thrombocytosis, Chills, Tachycardia, Normocytic anaemia, Anaemia of chronic disease, Body temperature abnormal, Febrile infection, Masked fever, Prerenal failure, Bone marrow failure, Postrenal failure, Body temperature decreased, Normochromic normocytic anaemia, Normochromic anaemia, Body temperature, Anaemia of malignant disease, Red blood cell count decreased, Respiratory failure, Azotaemia, Aplastic anaemia, Leukoerythroblastic anaemia, Urine output decreased, Platelet disorder, Erythropenia, Hypoplastic anaemia, Hypochromic anaemia\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
