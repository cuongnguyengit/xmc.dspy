ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Targeting the epichaperome as an effective precision medicine approach in a novel PML-SYK fusion acute myeloid leukemia. ABSTRACT: The epichaperome is a new cancer target composed of hyperconnected networks of chaperome members that facilitate cell survival. Cancers with an altered chaperone configuration may be susceptible to epichaperome inhibitors. We developed a flow cytometry-based assay for evaluation and monitoring of epichaperome abundance at the single cell level, with the goal of prospectively identifying patients likely to respond to epichaperome inhibitors, to measure target engagement, and dependency during treatment. As proof of principle, we describe a patient with an unclassified myeloproliferative neoplasm harboring a novel PML-SYK fusion, who progressed to acute myeloid leukemia despite chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant. The leukemia was identified as having high epichaperome abundance. We obtained compassionate access to an investigational epichaperome inhibitor, PU-H71. After 16 doses, the patient achieved durable complete remission. These encouraging results suggest that further investigation of epichaperome inhibitors in patients with abundant baseline epichaperome levels is warranted. TEXT: Introduction Precision medicine (PM) approaches in cancer treatment are designed to offer patient-specific, mechanistically driven selection of therapeutic strategies. Development of such \\\\u201cbespoke\\\\u201d treatment is hoped to improve current outcomes with conventional chemotherapy, especially in diseases like acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in which outcomes are especially dismal. PM takes into consideration the unique tumor molecular landscape or patient\\\\u2019s signature to determine potential therapeutic interventions. At the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine (EIPM) of Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) and New York\\\\u2010Presbyterian Hospital (NYP), we have implemented a program that includes whole\\\\u2010exome and RNA-sequencing to facilitate the determination of tumor molecular landscapes, and ex vivo drug screening to identify drug sensitivity and resistance1\\\\u20133.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Acute myeloid leukaemia, Chemotherapy, Allogenic stem cell transplantation, Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant, Stem cell transplant, Acute leukaemia, Treatment failure, Acute myeloid leukaemia (in remission), Drug ineffective, Stem cell donor, Acute myeloid leukaemia recurrent, Stem cell therapy, Allogenic bone marrow transplantation therapy, Acute undifferentiated leukaemia, Chemotherapy single agent systemic, Transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia, Prophylactic chemotherapy, Acute erythroid leukaemia, Chemotherapy multiple agents systemic, Acute myelomonocytic leukaemia, Regional chemotherapy, Disease progression, Remission not achieved, Acute monocytic leukaemia, Aleukaemic leukaemia, Myeloid leukaemia, Acute promyelocytic leukaemia, Autologous bone marrow transplantation therapy, Acute biphenotypic leukaemia, Chemotherapy side effect prophylaxis, Therapy partial responder, Blood stem cell harvest, Cancer in remission, Acute megakaryocytic leukaemia, Acute leukaemia in remission, T-cell type acute leukaemia, Chemotherapy toxicity attenuation, Chemotherapy extravasation management, Immunosuppression, Acute myeloid leukaemia refractory, B-cell type acute leukaemia, Bone marrow transplant, Acute lymphocytic leukaemia, Minimal residual disease, B precursor type acute leukaemia, Leukaemia, Acute bilineal leukaemia, Acute monocytic leukaemia (in remission), Drug therapy, Donor leukocyte infusion\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653990.6388526}
