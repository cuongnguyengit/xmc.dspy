ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: The peritonitis caused by gram-negative organisms is a serious complication encountered in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, often causing high morbidity and mortality. There has been recognition of peritonitis caused by uncommon organisms because of improved microbiological detection techniques. The healthcare providers involved in the management of these patients should be very vigilant. We report a rare case of peritonitis caused by Citrobacter freundii. A 42-year-old male on peritoneal dialysis for five years presented with abdominal pain and cloudy effluent. The peritoneal fluid analysis was consistent with peritonitis, and peritoneal fluid culture grew Citrobacter freundii. The patient was treated with two courses of double antibiotic coverage with intraperitoneal ceftazidime and oral ciprofloxacin, which failed to resolve the infection and hence resulted in the removal the peritoneal dialysis catheter and dialysis modality change. TEXT: Introduction Gram-negative organism peritonitis is a severe complication encountered in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, often causing high morbidity and mortality. The healthcare providers involved in the care of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis should recognize that unusual organisms could cause peritonitis. We report the case of a 42-year-old male on peritoneal dialysis presenting with Citrobacter freundii peritonitis. Citrobacter freundii (C. freundii) is a motile, facultative anaerobe, non-sporing gram-negative bacilli colonize in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other animals. It is also found in water, soil, and food.1 Werkman and Gillen discovered genus Citrobacter in 1932 and the organism uses citrate a sole carbon source for the energy source and hence derives its name.2 C. freundii is hydrogen sulfide positive, indole negative, adonitol negative, and malonate negative in character.3 Peritonitis from gram-negative organisms frequently results in hospitalization, catheter loss, dialysis modality change, and mortality. These infections are hard to treat because of biofilm formation, which makes them less susceptible to antibiotics.
