ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: The survival outcomes of the FLAURA trial support osimertinib as the new standard of care for untreated patients harboring activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Despite the initial response, disease progression invariably occurs. Although uncommon, BRAF V600E mutation arises as a unique mechanism of resistance, and thus far, no prospective studies are available to support concurrent EGFR/BRAF blockade. We report a case of impressive radiological and ctDNA response under dabrafenib, trametinib, and osimertinib in an advanced EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patient who developed BRAF V600E as one of the acquired resistance mechanisms to second-line osimertinib. Moreover, the patient experienced remarkable clinical improvement and good tolerance to combination therapy. The present case suggests the importance of prospective studies evaluating both efficacy and safety of the combination in later line settings and points towards the potential of ctDNA to monitor resistance mechanisms and treatment benefit in clinical practice. TEXT: Introduction The use of osimertinib to target epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has become the standard of care in untreated EGFR-mutant non\\\\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Although osimertinib can be highly active, showing more durable outcomes than first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI)1, most tumors invariably become resistant, limiting its long-term clinical benefit. The heterogeneity of resistance mechanisms to osimertinib, including EGFR C797S mutation, EGFR, and MET amplifications, off-target mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS, and HER2 as well as histologic transformation2\\\\u20139, has stimulated routine performance of repeated biopsies to identify specific underlying mechanisms of resistance throughout the treatment course, and to guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome and prevent acquired resistance (AR)7,10\\\\u201313. Combined targeted therapy (TT) strategies have been increasingly addressed in prospective clinical trials14\\\\u201317. A phase Ib/II trial reported 47% ORR with a combination of capmatinib (MET inhibitor) plus gefitinib in patients progressing to EGFR TKI and presenting MET dysregulation14. Likewise, SAVANNAH (NCT03778229)15 is an ongoing phase II trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of combination savolitinib and osimertinib in post-osimertinib progression/MET-positive patients. The biomarker-matched study ORCHARD (NCT03944772)16 is also underway to assess the efficacy of several osimertinib-based combinations following disease progression under frontline osimertinib.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Lung adenocarcinoma, Drug ineffective, Lung adenocarcinoma recurrent, Lung neoplasm malignant, Adenosquamous cell lung cancer, Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, Lung adenocarcinoma stage III, Lung adenocarcinoma stage IV, Lung adenocarcinoma stage 0, Metastases to lung, Lung adenocarcinoma stage II, Lung adenocarcinoma stage I, Non-small cell lung cancer, Adenosquamous cell lung cancer recurrent, EGFR gene mutation, Drug resistance, Bronchial carcinoma, Sarcomatoid carcinoma of the lung, Small cell lung cancer, Adenosquamous cell lung cancer stage 0, Lung infiltration malignant, Adenosquamous cell lung cancer stage III, Large cell lung cancer, Adenosquamous cell lung cancer stage I, Adenosquamous cell lung cancer stage IV, EGFR status assay, Adenocarcinoma, Lung cancer metastatic, Adenosquamous cell lung cancer stage II, Squamous cell carcinoma of lung, Non-small cell lung cancer metastatic, Lung carcinoma cell type unspecified recurrent, Neuroendocrine tumour of the lung, EGFR gene overexpression, Large cell lung cancer metastatic, Small cell lung cancer extensive stage, Carcinoid tumour pulmonary, Small cell lung cancer metastatic, Lung carcinoma cell type unspecified stage IV, Lung carcinoma cell type unspecified stage 0, Non-small cell lung cancer recurrent, Pneumonia, Malignant respiratory tract neoplasm, Neuroendocrine tumour of the lung metastatic, Small cell lung cancer limited stage, Human epidermal growth factor receptor increased, Lung carcinoma cell type unspecified stage III, Large cell lung cancer recurrent, Human epidermal growth factor receptor decreased, Non-small cell lung cancer stage IV\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

It also mentions the development of BRAF V600E as a resistance mechanism to osimertinib. The article does not explicitly mention adverse reactions to the drugs but discusses the disease progression and resistance to treatment.
