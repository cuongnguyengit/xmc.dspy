ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Case Report: Late-Onset Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: An Interplay Between Pre-existing Cortical Development Abnormality and Tissue Damage. ABSTRACT: Epileptogenicity following brain insult depends on various factors including severity of the resulting lesion and extent of brain damage. We report a 54-year-old female patient who developed medically refractory epilepsy resulting from the interplay of pre-existing and post-insult pathologies. She presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to a ruptured aneurysm and underwent clipping surgery. Seizures started 3 months post-operatively. MRI revealed cerebral ischemia and hemosiderin deposits in the left temporal lobes, and left hippocampal atrophy was suspected. As anti-seizure medications and vagus nerve stimulation failed to control her seizures, she underwent left temporal lobe resection and placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for the post-operative complication of hydrocephalus. She remains seizure-free to date. Neuropathology revealed a previously undiagnosed focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type 1a. Brain insult likely had a second hit effect in the late onset of epilepsy in this patient with pre-existing mild MCD, in whom secondary epilepsy can be attributed to the interplay of multiple underlying pathologies. TEXT: Highlights - Pre-existing and post-insult pathologies induced epileptogenicity - Late-onset medically refractory epilepsy with undiagnosed FCD Background Parenchymal hemosiderosis is a risk factor for focal epilepsy after intracerebral bleeding (1, 2). Epileptogenicity due to hemosiderosis is well-known and can be related to cavernous malformation (3), brain tumor (4), or intracranial hemorrhage (5, 6). The mechanism of epileptogenicity due to hemosiderosis includes abnormalities in neurotransmission and free radical formation (7). In neuropathology of temporal lobe epilepsy, epileptogenicity has been attributed to various lesions including hippocampal sclerosis, malformation of cortical development (focal cortical dysplasia\\\\u2014FCD\\\\u2014and gray matter heterotopia), as well low-grade tumors (8, 9). In daily practice, acute or remote damage resulting from a previous insult is considered as the sole cause of epileptogenicity. As many patients do not require surgery, information on etiology derives solely from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, many pre-existing and yet undiagnosed factors as well as complications from an acute insult can impact the establishment of an epilepsy network by affecting the neurotransmitter system and intracellular and extracellular homeostasis. Indeed, it is common clinical experience that some patients develop epilepsy following an insult and others do not, even though they have the same degree of brain damage.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Subarachnoid haemorrhage, Hydrocephalus, Cerebral haemorrhage, Ventriculo-peritoneal shunt, Aneurysm ruptured, Seizure, Haemorrhage intracranial, External hydrocephalus, Brain oedema, Subarachnoid haematoma, External vagal nerve stimulation, Subdural haemorrhage, Peripheral artery aneurysm rupture, Congenital hydrocephalus, Cerebral ventricle dilatation, Aneurysm perforation, Cortical dysplasia, Normal pressure hydrocephalus, Vascular pseudoaneurysm ruptured, Spinal subarachnoid haemorrhage, Aortic aneurysm rupture, Ventriculo-pleural shunt, Haemorrhage, Subarachnoid haemorrhage neonatal, Central nervous system haemorrhage, Aneurysm, Peritoneovenous shunt, Status epilepticus, Vascular pseudoaneurysm, Lumboperitoneal shunt, Epilepsy, Arterial rupture, Ventricular cisternostomy, Ventriculo-vascular shunt, Posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus, Subdural haematoma, Hydranencephaly, Cerebrospinal fluid retention, Ventriculo-cardiac shunt, Ruptured cerebral aneurysm, Brain lobectomy, Retinal aneurysm rupture, Hypertensive hydrocephalus, Vascular rupture, Seizure prophylaxis, Carotid aneurysm rupture, Cerebrospinal fluid reservoir placement, Spinal subdural haemorrhage, CSF shunt operation, Fibrous cortical defect\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
