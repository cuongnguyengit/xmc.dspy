ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Case Report: Three Rare Cases of Ectopic ACTH Syndrome Caused by Adrenal Medullary Hyperplasia. ABSTRACT: Ectopic ACTH syndrome (EAS) accounts for 10-20% of endogenous Cushing\\'s syndrome (CS). Hardly any cases of adrenal medullary hyperplasia have been reported to ectopically secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Here we describe a series of three patients with hypercortisolism secondary to ectopic production of ACTH from adrenal medulla. Cushingoid features were absent in case 1 but evident in the other two cases. Marked hypokalemia was found in all three patients, but hyperglycemia and osteoporosis were present only in case 2. All three patients showed significantly elevated serum cortisol and 24-h urinary cortisol levels. The ACTH levels ranged from 19.8 to 103.0pmol/L, favoring ACTH-dependent Cushing\\'s syndrome. Results of bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (BIPSS) for case 1 and case 3 confirmed ectopic origin of ACTH. The extremely high level of ACTH and failure to suppress cortisol with high dose dexamethasone suppression test (HDDST) suggested EAS for patient 2. However, image studies failed to identify the source of ACTH secretion. Bilateral adrenalectomy was performed for rapid control of hypercortisolism. After surgery, cushingoid features gradually disappeared for case 2 and case 3. Blood pressure, blood glucose and potassium levels returned to normal ranges without medication for case 2. The level of serum potassium also normalized without any supplementation for case 1 and case 3. The ACTH levels of all three patients significantly decreased 3-6 months after surgery. Histopathology revealed bilateral adrenal medullary hyperplasia and immunostaining showed positive ACTH staining located in adrenal medulla cells. In summary, our case series reveals the adrenal medulla to be a site of ectopic ACTH secretion. Adrenal medulla-originated EAS makes the differential diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing\\'s syndrome much more difficult. Control of the hypercortisolism is mandatory for such patients.
