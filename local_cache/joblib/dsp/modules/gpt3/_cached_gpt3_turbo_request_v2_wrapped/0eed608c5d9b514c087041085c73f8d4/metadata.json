ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Mycosis fungoides with penile involvement is extremely rare. Previous reports have shown successful treatment with imiquimod or a combination of beam radiation and chemotherapy. We present a patient with mycosis fungoides and penile involvement. The penile lesions were initially treated with topical imiquimod; however, he developed worsening glandular lesions and discharge. Therefore the treatment was discontinued. Subsequent treatment with brentuximab (anti-CD30) targeted therapy resulted in complete resolution of the penile lesions. To our knowledge, this represents the first case of a complete penile mycosis fungoides response to brentuximab therapy. Brentuximab may be considered for refractory penile mycoses fungoides. TEXT: Abbreviations 1. MFMycosis Fungoides 2. CTCLCutaneous T-cell lymphoma 3. CHOPCyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, prednisone Introduction Mycosis fungoides (MF) is the predominant form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and accounts for 50\\\\u201365% of cases.1 MF is rare, with an incidence in the United States of only 0.3\\\\u20131 cases per 100,000. MF can be identified as erythematous patches or plaques, most often in a non-sun-exposed (so-called bathing trunk) distribution. Most patients present with patches or plaques, representing early stage disease; rarely, MF can progress to more advance stages with tumors or erythroderma. Treatment of early stage MF commonly includes topical therapies such as corticosteroids, nitrogen mustard, phototherapy, imiquimod, retinoids and local radiation.2,3 Advanced disease requires systemic treatment, such as bexarotene, methotrexate, histone deacetylase inhibitors, pralatrexate, brentuximab vedotin (anti-CD30), and/or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.2,4 Early diagnosis and treatment is generally associated with a good prognosis, and 5-year survival rates approach 90%.1 Penile involvement with MF is rare with only 2 cases reported in the literature.3,5 We present the first report of complete response of penile MF with systemic brentuximab therapy.
