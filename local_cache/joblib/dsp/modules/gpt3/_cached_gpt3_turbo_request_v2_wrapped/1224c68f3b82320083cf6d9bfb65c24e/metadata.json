ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is an uncommon and life-threating condition characterized by major immune activation and massive cytokine production by mononuclear inflammatory cells, due to defects in cytotoxic lymphocyte function. It is even more unusual in renal transplant recipients, in which it is often associated with uncontrolled infection. The mortality is high in HLH and differential diagnosis with sepsis is a challenge. The approach and management depend on the underlying trigger and comorbidities. We report a case of a 50-year-old renal transplant female admitted with fever and malaise 3 months post-transplant and presenting anemia, fever, hypertriglyceridemia, high levels of serum ferritin, and positive CMV antigenemia. Urine was positive for decoy cells and BKV-DNA. Graft biopsy showed CMV nephritis. Both blood and urine cultures where positive for E. coli. Hemophagocytosis was confirmed by bone marrow aspiration. Immunosuppression was reduced, and the patient received high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin and dexamethasone, with complete response after 3 weeks. We highlight the importance of early diagnosis and proper management of a rare and serious condition in a renal transplant patient, which can allow a favorable clinical course and improve survival rate. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) consists of an immune hyperactivation syndrome that takes place when NK cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes fail to eliminate activated macrophages, leading to over production of proinflammatory cytokines1. There are primary and acquired causes. Primary HLH is rare and typically manifests in childhood because of two autosomal recessive defects in genes that encode proteins involved in the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules during apoptosis in natural killer (NK) cells.1 , 2Acquired (secondary) HLH is triggered by various conditions as infections, immunodeficiency, rheumatologic diseases, and cancer.1 , 3 , 4 Infection is the most common precipitating factor of HLH in adults, mainly viruses of herpes family (EBV, CMV, HSV, HHV8), but bacterial, fungal, and parasitic pathogens can also be a trigger.5 , 6 Multiorgan involvement and organomegaly are frequently found and hemophagocytosis results in pancytopenia. Diagnosis of HLH is based on the presence of at least 5 of the following 8 criteria: fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias (affecting \\\\u2265 2 lineages of peripheral blood cells), hypertriglyceridemia and/or hypofibrinogenemia, serum ferritin >500 ng/mL, low activity of NK cells, soluble CD25 > 2.400 U/mL and hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, or lymph nodes.7 Hemophagocytosis is characterized by the presence of red cells, platelets, or white cells in macrophage cytoplasm visualized in bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.2 The syndrome is defined by a complex picture. However, some patients may have incipient or partial disease.1 Most diagnostic\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Neutropenia, Pancytopenia, Infection, Thrombocytopenia, Cytomegalovirus infection, Febrile neutropenia, Bone marrow failure, Haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Leukopenia, Hypertriglyceridaemia, Anaemia, Cytopenia, Fungal infection, Hyperglycaemia, Apoptosis, Bacterial infection, Herpes simplex, Agranulocytosis, Sepsis, Hyperlipidaemia, Granulocytopenia, Hypercholesterolaemia, Condition aggravated, Blood triglycerides increased, Platelet count decreased, Hyper HDL cholesterolaemia, Aplastic anaemia, Herpes virus infection, Pyrexia, Cell death, Herpes simplex hepatitis, Cytomegalovirus viraemia, Familial hypertriglyceridaemia, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Cytomegalovirus infection reactivation, Immune-mediated pancytopenia, Disease progression, Familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, Type III hyperlipidaemia, Acquired mixed hyperlipidaemia, Varicella, Type I hyperlipidaemia, Autoimmune pancytopenia, Type II hyperlipidaemia, Infection parasitic, Type V hyperlipidaemia, Blood cholesterol increased, Lipids increased, Type IV hyperlipidaemia, Plasmablast count decreased\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: OBJECTIVE Emergence agitation (EA) is frequently observed in children undergoing general anaesthesia. This study tested whether the addition of an intra-operative low-dose infusion of dexmedetomidine to fentanyl treatment reduced the incidence of emergence delirium following desflurane anesthesia in children undergoing strabismus surgery. METHODS A total of 96 children (1-5 years old) undergoing strabismus surgery were enrolled. Anaesthesia was induced with propofol and maintained with desflurane. After induction, fentanyl (1 \\\\u03bcg/kg) was administered to all children. During surgery, patients were infused with 0.2 \\\\u03bcg/(kg\\\\u00b7h)\\\\u207b\\\\u00b9 dexmedetomidine (Group FD, n=47) or normal saline (Group F, n=47). Postoperative objective pain score (OPS), Paediatric Agitation and Emergence Delirium (PAED) score, and EA score were documented every 10 minutes in the post-anaesthesia care unit. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the two groups in demographic characteristics and haemodynamic changes. The mean values of maximum EA, maximum PAED, and maximum OPS score were significantly lower in Group FD than in Group F at 0, 10, and 20 minutes after arrival at the post-anaesthesia care unit (p<0.001). The frequency of fentanyl rescue was lower in Group FD than in Group F (p<0.001). The incidence of severe EA was significantly lower in Group FD than in Group F (12.8% vs. 74.5%, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS Intra-operative low-dose infusion of dexmedetomidine in addition to fentanyl reduces EA following desflurane anaesthesia in children undergoing strabismus surgeries. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Emergence delirium (ED) and emergence agitation (EA) are common phenomenon in paediatric patients undergoing general anaesthesia by inhalation agents. The incidence of ED or EA was reported to range from 18% to 80%.1,2 Agitated behaviour associated with ED can delay discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU), decrease parent and caregiver satisfaction, and increase the overall cost to the institution.3 Risk factors for development of ED include preschool age, previous surgery, adaptability, ophthalmology or otorhinolaryngology procedure, and inhalation agents associated with fast emergence.1,4 Strabismus surgery is one of the most common ophthalmologic operations in children under 5 years old and can be associated with moderate postoperative pain caused by the conjunctiva5 and a high incidence of EA (40-86%).6-9 As this procedure commonly elicits the oculo-cardiac reflex (OCR) by traction on extraocular muscles and their adnexa or by application of sudden pressure to the eye or orbit, arrhythmias such as bradycardia are frequently encountered during the procedure. Therefore, anaesthetic strategies for strabismus surgery in paediatric patients include prevention of haemodynamic instability as well as reduction of postoperative pain and EA.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Bradycardia, Haemodynamic instability, Tachycardia, Arrhythmia, Bradyarrhythmia, Confusional state, Sinus bradycardia, Delirium, Palpitations, Hypotension, Central bradycardia, Pain, Intensive care unit delirium, Sinus tachycardia, Heart rate decreased, Somnolence, Agitation, Postoperative delirium, Heart rate irregular, Cardiac arrest, Post-injection delirium sedation syndrome, Pain assessment, Tachyarrhythmia, Acute kidney injury, Pulse volume decreased, Confusion postoperative, Heart rate variability decreased, Delirium tremens, Disorientation, Coma, Heart rate abnormal, Agitation postoperative, Headache, Diastolic dysfunction, Sinus rhythm, Cardiac failure, Sinus arrhythmia, Paediatric early warning score, Nodal rhythm, Loss of consciousness, Confusional arousal, Systolic dysfunction, Cardiac dysfunction, Heart rate, Altered state of consciousness, Delirium febrile, Infusion, Maximum heart rate decreased, Orthostatic hypotension, Haemodynamic test abnormal\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
