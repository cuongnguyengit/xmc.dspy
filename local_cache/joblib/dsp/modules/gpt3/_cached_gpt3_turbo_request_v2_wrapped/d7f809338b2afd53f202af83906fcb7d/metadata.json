ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\\\\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: We recently published a clinically-meaningful improvement in median overall survival (OS) for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), >30% bone marrow (BM) blasts and white blood cell (WBC) count \\\\u226415 G/L, treated with front-line azacitidine versus conventional care regimens within a phase 3 clinical trial (AZA-AML-001; NCT01074047; registered: February 2010). As results obtained in clinical trials are facing increased pressure to be confirmed by real-world data, we aimed to test whether data obtained in the AZA-AML-001 trial accurately represent observations made in routine clinical practice by analysing additional AML patients treated with azacitidine front-line within the Austrian Azacitidine Registry (AAR; NCT01595295; registered: May 2012) and directly comparing patient-level data of both cohorts. We assessed the efficacy of front-line azacitidine in a total of 407 patients with newly-diagnosed AML. Firstly, we compared data from AML patients with WBC \\\\u2264 15 G/L and >30% BM blasts included within the AZA-AML-001 trial treated with azacitidine (\\\\\"AML-001\\\\\" cohort; n = 214) with AAR patients meeting the same inclusion criteria (\\\\\"AAR (001-like)\\\\\" cohort; n = 95). The current analysis thus represents a new sub-analysis of the AML-001 trial, which is directly compared with a new sub-analysis of the AAR. Baseline characteristics, azacitidine application, response rates and OS were comparable between all patient cohorts within the trial or registry setting. Median OS was 9.9 versus 10.8 months (p = 0.616) for \\\\\"AML-001\\\\\" versus \\\\\"AAR (001-like)\\\\\" cohorts, respectively. Secondly, we pooled data from both cohorts (n = 309) and assessed the outcome. Median OS of the pooled cohorts was 10.3 (95% confidence interval: 8.7, 12.6) months, and the one-year survival rate was 45.8%. Thirdly, we compared data from AAR patients meeting AZA-AML-001 trial inclusion criteria (n = 95) versus all AAR patients with World Health Organization (WHO)-defined AML (\\\\\"AAR (WHO-AML)\\\\\" cohort; n = 193). Within the registry population, median OS for AAR patients meeting trial inclusion criteria versus all WHO-AML patients was 10.8 versus 11.8 months (p = 0.599), respectively. We thus tested and confirmed the efficacy of azacitidine as a front-line agent in patients with AML, >30% BM blasts and WBC \\\\u2264 15 G/L in a routine clinical practice setting. We further show that the efficacy of azacitidine does not appear to be limited to AML patients who meet stringent clinical trial inclusion criteria, but instead appears efficacious as front-line treatment in all patients with WHO-AML.
