The vacancy mentions a degree in \\\\\"Production Mechanical Electrical Marine Engineering (or similar)\\\\\" and the candidate might be \\\\\"newly educated.\\\\\" This suggests that the job requires a foundational understanding of engineering principles, particularly in the fields mentioned. Since the candidate might be newly educated, we can infer that the job may not require extensive experience but rather a solid educational background in the relevant engineering disciplines. We should look for skills that are related to mechanical, electrical, and marine engineering, as well as general engineering competencies that a recent graduate might possess.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: marine engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, operate mechanical equipment of ships, manage ship electrical systems, operate ship equipment, maintain shipboard machinery, maritime transportation technology, offshore constructions and facilities, provide support in vessel machinery systems\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: SQL experience is a plus but not required\\\\n\\\\nOptions: SQL, SQL Server, database, MySQL, use databases, PostgreSQL, Oracle Relational Database, data warehouse, database management systems, use query languages, query languages, manage database, Microsoft Access, operate relational database management system, database development tools, maintain database, data analytics, Teradata Database, CA Datacom/DB, business intelligence, Solidity, SPARQL, search databases, database quality standards, perform data mining, perform records management, data models, data mining, Drupal, maintain database performance, create data models, NoSQL, create database diagrams, manage quantitative data, implement data warehousing techniques, develop data processing applications, PHP, accounting, C#, design database scheme, SAP Data Services, DB2, use logic programming, manage data, data storage, balance database resources, SAS Data Management, perform data analysis, use accounting systems, use data processing techniques\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as beneficial for the job vacancy. The vacancy mentions \\\\\"SQL experience is a plus but not required,\\\\\" which suggests that while SQL skills are advantageous, they are not a mandatory requirement for the job. Therefore, we should focus on skills related to SQL and databases, as these are the most relevant to the statement provided.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: Skills: SQL, use databases, use query languages, query languages, manage database, database management systems, operate relational database management system, maintain database, create data models, manage data\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: Are you ready to work in a dynamic and international team?\\\\n\\\\nOptions: stimulate creativity in the team, manage a team, build team spirit, team building, lead a team, organise information on availability of the team, manage athletes touring abroad, implement relevant tactical skills to perform at the highest level in sport, shape organisational teams based on competencies, work in teams, organise sporting environment, work in a land-based team, implement relevant technical skills to perform at the highest level in sport, collaborate with coaching team, encourage teambuilding, work in professional sport environment, coach staff for running the performance, plan teamwork, develop a coaching style, direct an artistic team, assemble an artistic team, plan the work of teams and individuals, consult team on creative project, manage internal process of a sport organisation, organise participation in international events, organise supporters, develop opportunities for progression in sport, manage sporting career, develop competitive strategies in sport, teamwork principles, work to develop physical ability to perform at the highest level in sport, motivate supporters, apply risk management in sports, promote sports organisation, work in fitness teams, develop practices to conduct effective sport club management, encourage teams for continuous improvement, manage personal professional development in sport, organise participation in local or international events, coaching techniques, work with an artistic team, manage creative department, coordinate the administration of a sports organisation, manage sales teams, carry out interviews to select artistic team members, manage athletes, develop staff, subject of coaching, insourcing strategy, coach young people\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706652495.3045657}
