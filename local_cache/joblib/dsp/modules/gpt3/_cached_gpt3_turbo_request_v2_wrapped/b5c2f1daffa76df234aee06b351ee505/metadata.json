ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Successful treatment with Cinryze\\\\u00ae replacement therapy of a pregnant patient with hereditary angioedema: a case report. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease characterized with recurrent swelling of subcutaneous or mucosal tissue that resolves in approximately 3 days. It can be presented with peripheral edema, abdominal and life-threatening laryngeal angioedema. A variety of triggers are known to cause episodes of angioedema including estrogen exposure. There are different reports regarding the effect of pregnancy on HAE attacks, and in some patients, the pregnancy is a recognized triggering factor. METHODS We present a female Caucasian patient with pre-existing HAE and disease exacerbations during pregnancy, requiring prophylactic use of plasma-derived C1 inhibitor concentrate. She was treated with Cinryze\\\\u00ae replacement therapy throughout the pregnancy 1000 IU i.v. 48 times. She gave birth to a healthy male infant, via C-section. After the delivery, the patient was symptom-free for 6 months and required no treatment for HAE. CONCLUSIONS In the case presented, the angioedema attacks worsened as the pregnancy progressed. The treatment with Cinryze\\\\u00ae replacement therapy was effective and safe during pregnancy, with no adverse effects on the infant. TEXT: Introduction Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare disease characterized with recurrent swelling of subcutaneous or mucosal tissue, without pruritus or urticaria, that resolves in approximately 3 days. The disease can be presented with peripheral edema, abdominal, but also with life-threatening laryngeal angioedema [1]. Several types of HAE are described; the most explored one is due to C1 inhibitor deficiency, known as type I. It is caused by SERPING 1 mutation, on the long arm of chromosome 11, leading to C1 inhibitor deficiency which subsequently results in low C1 inhibitor and C4 protein levels in blood serum [2]. A variety of triggers, such as stress, surgical procedures, some medications (ACE inhibitors, estrogen-containing medication) are identified to cause episodes of angioedema [3, 4]. There are different reports regarding the effect of pregnancy on HAE attacks, and in some patients, the pregnancy is a known triggering factor. We present a female patient with HAE and frequent disease exacerbations during pregnancy, that required prophylactic use of plasma-derived C1 inhibitor concentrate (pdC1) throughout the pregnancy. Case presentation We present a female Caucasian patient with HAE type I, diagnosed at the age of 26, with SERPING 1 mutation (confirmed by molecular testing), with very low C1inhibitor and C4 levels. Molecular testing was also positive for her father and brother. They also had low C1 inhibitor and C4 levels, but they never had any HAE symptoms.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Drug ineffective, Drug interaction, Supplementation therapy, Renal replacement therapy, Progestin replacement therapy, Hormone replacement therapy, Complement factor C2, Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, Complement factor C3, Electrolyte substitution therapy, Antacid therapy, Nutritional supplementation, Multiple drug therapy, Complement factor C4, Complement factor, Enzyme supplementation, Protein C, Mineral supplementation, Oestrogen replacement therapy, Prothrombin fragment 1.2, Anti-complement antibody, Vitamin supplementation, Treatment failure, Hypercalcaemia therapy, Plasminogen activator inhibitor, Circulating anticoagulant, Drug resistance, C1 esterase inhibitor test, Acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency, Antioxidant therapy, Drug therapy enhancement, Drug detoxification, Hepatobilliary disorder prophylaxis, Fluid replacement, Therapy change, Drug therapy, Platelet factor 4, Plasmin inhibitor, Hormone therapy, Blood alkalinisation therapy, Metabolic disorder prophylaxis, Androgen replacement therapy, Preoperative hormone treatment, Complement factor C1 increased, Drug diversion, Complement factor C2 increased, Thyroid hormone replacement therapy, Drug implantation, Thrombin-antithrombin III complex, Platelet rich plasma therapy\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653995.1611266}
