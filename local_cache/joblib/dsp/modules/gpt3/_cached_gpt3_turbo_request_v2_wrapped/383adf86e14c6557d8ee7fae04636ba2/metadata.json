ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \\\\\"found down\\\\\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \\\\u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \\\\u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\\\\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\\\\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \\\\u201ccatch up\\\\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Insomnia, Compartment syndrome, Crush syndrome, Somnolence, Acute kidney injury, Fatigue, Sleep disorder, Sleep deficit, Poor quality sleep, Sleep inertia, Sleep terror, Irregular sleep phase, Behavioural induced insufficient sleep syndrome, Middle insomnia, Parasomnia, Dyssomnia, Terminal insomnia, Abnormal sleep-related event, Abdominal compartment syndrome, Delayed sleep phase, Psychophysiologic insomnia, Paradoxical insomnia, Advanced sleep phase, Somnambulism, Crush injury, Sleep attacks, Sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, Hyposomnia, Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, Orbital compartment syndrome, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition insomnia type, Condition aggravated, Initial insomnia, Irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition parasomnia type, Hypersomnia, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition mixed type, Myalgia, Bedridden, Behavioural insomnia of childhood, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition hypersomnia type, Decompression sickness, Breathing-related sleep disorder, Loss of dreaming, Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Rapid eye movements sleep abnormal, Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Lethargy, Crushing injury of trunk, Sudden onset of sleep\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: A single dose of pegfilgrastim or the daily administration of colony-stimulating factors can be used to prevent febrile neutropenia. This may delay the detection of rapidly progressive infections among cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. We report a case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremic pneumonia that occurred in a patient receiving pegfilgrastim. TEXT: Introduction With the spread of outpatient chemotherapy, pegfilgrastim has been used for the prevention of febrile neutropenia (FN) because its prolonged half-life permits single-dose administration. However, cancer patients receiving chemotherapy are always at risk of invasive infections regardless of the presence of neutropenia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremic pneumonia (PABP) is an infection that is usually fatal, which generally occurs in neutropenic patients undergoing chemotherapy. This is the first report of a case of PABP in a solid cancer patient without neutropenia following outpatient chemotherapy and pegfilgrastim treatment. Case Report A 69-year-old man presented with high fever and general fatigue. He had been diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic cancer with multiple lung metastases two and a half years previously. He had been treated with gemcitabine (GEM) for two years and then TS-1 for 1 month. He developed FN after his first course of third-line chemotherapy with navelbine plus GEM due to progressive disease. Thereafter, he received outpatient chemotherapy along with pegfilgrastim. Fourteen days after the fifth course of third-line chemotherapy, he visited the hospital on the date of his scheduled outpatient appointment. He had a high fever (39\\\\u00b0C) and general fatigue and was admitted to hospital with a suspected lung abscess. On admission, the patient had no cough, sputum, dyspnea, chest pain, headache, or vomiting. He had no known contact with sick individuals. A physical examination revealed a body temperature of 39.0\\\\u00b0C, a pulse rate of 66 beats/min, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and blood pressure of 90/56 mmHg. Lungs auscultation was clear, with the exception of decreased breath sounds in the right lung. No heart murmur was audible. There was mild pitting edema in his lower legs. Chest radiography on arrival showed consolidation in the upper field of the right lung (Fig. 1). Computed tomography (CT) disclosed a cavitary lesion, measuring 45\\\\u00d743 mm, with surrounding inflammation in the right upper lobe (Fig. 2). The laboratory data showed that he did not have neutropenia (white blood cell [WBC] count, 44,700/\\\\u03bcL [neutrophils, 93%]). The other values were as follows: hemoglobin, 8.7 g/dL; platelets, 239,000/\\\\u03bcL; aspirate aminotransferase, 24 U/L; alanine aminotransferase, 15 U/L; lactic dehydrogenase, 272 U/L; total protein, 5.3 g/dL; albumin, 2.1 g/dL; creatinine, 0.87 mg/dL; serum urea nitrogen, 26 mg/dL; and C-reactive protein, 7.9 mg/dL.
