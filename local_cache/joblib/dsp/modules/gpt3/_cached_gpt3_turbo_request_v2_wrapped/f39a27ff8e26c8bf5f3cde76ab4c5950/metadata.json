ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Combined pulsed-dye laser and medical therapy for treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis lesions: a case report. ABSTRACT: Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that most frequently occurs in the lungs. However, cutaneous lesions are often the primary sign. Cutaneous sarcoidosis is difficult to treat, although different therapies have been applied. We herein report a case in which cutaneous sarcoidosis was treated with pulsed-dye laser (PDL) therapy along with oral administration of acitretin and hydroxychloroquine; no topical medications were applied. All patient details are de-identified. The treatment areas gradually improved after several courses of PDL therapy. This case illustrates that PDL therapy can serve as an auxiliary treatment for cutaneous sarcoidosis. TEXT: Introduction Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that most frequently occurs in the lungs. However, cutaneous lesions, which are present in approximately 10% to 30% of affected patients, are often the primary sign.1,2 Cutaneous sarcoidosis has various clinical manifestations, such as papules and plaques. Regardless of the clinical presentation, noncaseating granulomas are the most characteristic histologic manifestation. Cutaneous sarcoidosis remains difficult to treat, although different therapies have been applied. We herein report a case in which cutaneous sarcoidosis was improved by pulsed-dye laser (PDL) therapy. Case report In December 2018, a 46-year-old Asian woman presented for a consultation regarding left facial lesions (Figure 1(a)), which had been gradually increasing in size for more than 7 years. Symptoms such as pain and pruritus were absent. Figure 1. Clinical photographs before and after the treatment. (a) Initial findings. The main lesion was a red plaque with an approximate size of 8 \\\\u00d7 8 cm anterior to the left ear and involving the auricle. Telangiectasia was visible in the middle of the plaque, surrounded by several papules and nodules. (b) Findings 15 months post-treatment. The plaque was thinned (which was more obvious in the marked yellow rectangular regions) after the use of oral acitretin and hydroxychloroquine and 10 pulsed-dye laser therapy sessions. These changes were more clearly visible in the central lesion, where several tiny islands of normal skin had appeared (green arrows). Telangiectasia was less obvious (yellow arrow). However, some small papules had emerged in the periphery (blue arrows). The patient had visited several hospitals. Laboratory test results were normal, and a T-SPOT.TB test was negative. Chest computed tomography showed no evidence of organ involvement. Pulmonary function tests and electrocardiograms were normal. Repeated histopathological examinations suggested a noncaseating granulomatous disease, and acid-fast staining was negative. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction analysis detected no Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA in the tissues.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Low-level laser therapy, Laser therapy, Eye laser surgery, Retinal laser coagulation, Photodynamic therapy, Photocoagulation, Red light therapy, Phototherapy, Laser brain ablation, UV light therapy, Cervical laser therapy, Photon radiation therapy to soft tissue, Photon radiation therapy, Photorejuvenation, Laser speckle contrast imaging, Drug ineffective, Photon radiation therapy to blood, Electroporation therapy, Irreversible electroporation, Fulguration, Ubiquinone, Photon radiation therapy to skin, High frequency ablation, Photodynamic diagnostic procedure, Bioptic eye surgery, Transpupillary thermotherapy, Electrocoagulation, Electron radiation therapy to soft tissue, Infrared therapy, X-ray therapy to skin, Brachytherapy to soft tissue, High intensity focused ultrasound, Eye laser scar, Electron radiation therapy to blood, X-ray therapy to soft tissue, Diadynamic electrotherapy, Brachytherapy to skin, Thermal ablation, Chloracne, Electrocauterisation, Extracorporeal shock wave therapy, Radiotherapy to soft tissue, Gamma radiation therapy to soft tissue, Robotic surgery, Loop electrosurgical excision procedure, Electron radiation therapy to skin, Phototherapeutic keratectomy, Radiotherapy to skin, Tumour treating fields therapy, Light anaesthesia\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653895.860773}
