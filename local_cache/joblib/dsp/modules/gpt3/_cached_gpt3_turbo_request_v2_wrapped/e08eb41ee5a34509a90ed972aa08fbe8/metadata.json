ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Mycoplasma hominis meningitis in an extremely preterm newborn: a case report. ABSTRACT: Mycoplasma Hominis is a micro-organism which is a part of the human genitourinary tract flora. Neonates are susceptible to acquire this pathogen either in utero or through vertical transmission. In rare cases, it may cause central nervous system infections with severe morbidity and mortality in preterm and term neonates. We present a case of Mycoplasma Hominis meningitis in an extremely preterm neonate who presented with lethargy, tachycardia and seizures on day 7 of life. There was no history of maternal systemic or genitourinary infection during pregnancy and at the time of delivery. Empirical antibiotic therapy for neonatal meningitis was commenced after sending blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed pleocytosis with neutrophilic predominance, but no bacteria was identified on gram staining. Blood culture yielded no growth of any bacterial pathogen. However, growth of Mycoplasma Hominis was suspected in cerebrospinal fluid culture which was confirmed by 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase chain reaction analysis. Subsequently, antibiotics were changed to Moxifloxacin and Doxycycline which were given for a total duration of 6 weeks. Multiple cerebrospinal fluid cultures were performed during this treatment. No growth of any pathogen was identified on any of these cerebrospinal fluid cultures. We report a rare case of Mycoplasma Hominis meningitis in an extremely preterm neonate which was successfully treated with a combination therapy of Moxifloxacin and Doxycycline. It is important to consider the possibility of Mycoplasma Hominis meningitis in neonates who present with clinical signs and pleocytosis in cerebrospinal fluid but negative gram staining and no growth on conventional culture media. TEXT: Background Mycoplasma Hominis is a frequent habitant of the human genital tract [1]. Neonates are susceptible to acquire this microbe either in utero or through the colonized birth canal during the process of parturition [2]. However, invasive infections with this organism in preterm and term infants are noted to be rare [1, 3]. We describe an unusual case of neonatal meningitis due to Mycoplasma Hominis, confirmed in bacterial cultures and 16s ribosomal RNA Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. This case report demonstrates the importance of suspecting Mycoplasma Hominis as a cause of central nervous system (CNS) infection in neonates who present with clinical signs but no growth on conventional bacterial cultures and no improvement on empirical antibiotic treatment.
