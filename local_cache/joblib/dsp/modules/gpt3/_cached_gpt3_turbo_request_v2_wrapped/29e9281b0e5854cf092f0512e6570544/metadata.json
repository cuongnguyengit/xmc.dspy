ABSTRACT: We describe the case of a patient presenting with odd neurologic symptoms initially thought to represent somatization who was found to have critical hypokalemia manifesting as hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis. It was determined that the patient had baseline hypokalemia as a function of alcohol abuse, exacerbated by self overmedication with hydrochlorothiazide for elevated blood pressure readings at home. The diagnosis was suspected when an electrocardiogram was obtained demonstrating a pseudo-prolonged QT interval with ST depression, consistent with T-U wave fusion and a QU interval with an absent T wave.1 The patient received oral and intravenous potassium and magnesium supplementation with resolution of symptoms. TEXT: INTRODUCTION We report a rare and unusual case of hypokalemic non-periodic paralysis (HNPP) precipitated by thiazide diuretic overuse in the setting of alcoholic malnutrition. HNPP associated with thiazide diuretics is extremely rare and reported only sparingly in the literature. Unique features of this case include the patient\\\\u2019s non-specific presentation, pathognomonic electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and the severity of the patient\\\\u2019s hypokalemia and associated hypomagnesemia. The patient had complete resolution of symptoms with electrolyte repletion in the emergency department (ED). We discuss the incidence and mechanism of hypokalemic paralysis and a detailed description of the patient\\\\u2019s presentation as a reminder for emergency physicians to consider HNPP in the differential diagnosis of patients treated with thiazide diuretics presenting with neurologic symptoms. CASE REPORT A 53-year old female with a history of alcohol abuse, anxiety, and hypertension presented to the ED with a chief complaint of \\\\u201cI think I\\\\u2019m having a stroke.\\\\u201d The patient reported inability to move her face or hands since awaking that morning, about 30 minutes prior to arrival. She was immediately assessed by physician and nursing staff after triage personnel initiated a rapid stroke evaluation. On physical exam, the patient held her mouth immobile and partly open, even while talking. On neurologic exam, the patient\\\\u2019s hands and wrists appeared to be flaccid, with wrists held in passive flexion. Passive range of motion of all extremities was normal with no spasticity. Muscle strength was assessed at 1/5 in wrist flexion and extension, and 4/5 throughout the remainder of the bilateral extremities. She was unable to comply with cerebellar testing due to weakness. There was no clonus. The rest of the physical exam was unremarkable, including vital signs, which demonstrated a heart rate of 96 beats per minute, blood pressure of 136/88 millimeters of mercury, respirations of 16 breaths per minute, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air. The patient was afebrile with an oral temperature of 97.6 degrees Fahrenheit.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Hypokalaemia, Anxiety, Hypomagnesaemia, Blood pressure increased, Hypotension, Hyponatraemia, Alcohol abuse, Hyperkalaemia, Hypocalcaemia, Alcohol use disorder, Blood potassium decreased, Alcoholism, Alcohol problem, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Drug abuse, Alcohol use, Anxiety disorder, Labile hypertension, Malignant hypertension, Hypokalaemic syndrome, Panic reaction, Alcoholic, Hypertensive urgency, Essential hypertension, Hypermagnesaemia, Nervousness, Urine potassium decreased, Alcohol poisoning, Panic disorder, Fear, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Alcoholic psychosis, Panic attack, Hypertensive angiopathy, Orthostatic hypertension, Generalised anxiety disorder, Alkalosis hypokalaemic, Electrolyte imbalance, Phobia, Alcoholic coma, Blood magnesium decreased, Idiosyncratic alcohol intoxication, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Renal hypertension, Blood alcohol, Prehypertension\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Introduction.Staphylococcus caprae is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that has been reported in several cases as a human pathogen. However, it has rarely been reported as pathogen in native bone. Furthermore, the reported MIC levels noted in the literature for vancomycin were <2 \\\\u00b5g ml-1making vancomycin a first line choice for infected patients. Case presentation. We report a case of Staphylococcus caprae causing osteomyelitis of the lumbar spine and bacteraemia and resulting in sepsis and ultimately the demise of a patient despite appropriate prolonged antibiotic therapy. Conclusion.Staphylococcus caprae has been reported as a human pathogen since 1983 when it was discovered. We report a case involving native bone infection which is rare in the absence of mechanical hardware. Furthermore, this strain had an elevated MIC for vancomycin which has not been reported in the literature.

Introduction Staphylococcus caprae is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus that was first described in 1983 after being isolated from goats where it causes mastitis [1\\\\u20134]. S. caprae typically colonizes human skin, nose and nails and since 1983 it has been reported in several cases as a human pathogen causing peritonitis, meningitis, urinary tract infections, endocarditis, endophthalmitis, prosthetic joint infections, recurrent sepsis, bacteraemia and osteomyelitis [4\\\\u20139]. Many risk factors for S. caprae have begun to emerge and include immunosuppression, diabetes, chronic renal failure, obesity, open or traumatic fractures and contact with sheep or goats [4, 6]. Importantly, several strains of S. caprae have been noted to produce toxic shock syndrome toxin and carry the gene mecA important for methicillin resistance, and have been noted to form a biofilm in vitro on prostheses or bone thought to be due to the presence of the gene altC in combination with the ica operon [1, 4, 6, 10]. Very few cases of S. caprae bone and joint infection occur in native bone and joints without prostheses, and there are few cases of bacteraemia not associated with line infections. In this case report we present Staphylococcus caprae infection of native vertebrae with resulting bacteraemia and ultimately failure of therapy, and summarize the current case reports of infection with this organism.
