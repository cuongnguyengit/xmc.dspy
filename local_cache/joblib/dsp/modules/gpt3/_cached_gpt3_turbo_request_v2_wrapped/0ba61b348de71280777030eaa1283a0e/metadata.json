ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Rare cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 infection and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine with a unique pattern similarity. ABSTRACT: In December 2019, a new emerging virus causing mild-to-severe pneumonia was detected in China. The virus was described as a variant of SARS-CoV and was called SARS-CoV-2, then declared a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. Millions of people contracted the virus and presented with a symptomatology of variable severity, including upper respiratory tract symptoms, systemic symptoms and diarrhea. We herein report a rare skin presentation in a 33-year-old female that occurred both during COVID-19 infection and after receiving the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. TEXT: pmcBackground In December 2019, in the city of Wuhan, severe respiratory infections had been reported and seemed to develop into an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Identified in January 2020 and labeled as a pandemic by the WHO in March 2020, the virus became a global health issue and caused a worldwide sanitary crisis [1]. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus binding to type 2 alveolar cells in the lung with ACE 2 receptor by a surface spike protein. It can also interact with different cells in the GI tract, kidney, heart and endothelium causing multiorgan failure [2]. The ability of the virus to bind to different cells explains the broad range of symptoms that it can cause. Skin lesions have been reported as a possible symptom of COVID-19. The skin lesions related to this virus consist of five patterns: livedo or necrosis, maculopapular eruptions, urticarial lesions, vesicular eruptions and pseudo-chilblain lesions [3]. Here, we describe the case of a patient with an uncommon pattern of maculopapular eruption during SARS-CoV-2 infection and after receiving COVID-19 vaccine. Case report We present the case of a 33-year-old female patient, working as a nurse in the medicine department. She was admitted to the emergency unit on 15 November 2020 for oppressive chest pain, fever, cough, tachycardia and fatigue. A PCR test was positive on 10 November with a cycle threshold (CT) of 18. The severe symptomatology started 24 h before presenting to the emergency department. She also noted having some chills and generalized fatigue within the previous 72 h. The patient was conscious and oriented in space, time and toward people. Blood pressure on admission was 140/80 mmHg, heart rate was 100 beats/min. Patient respiratory rate was 16 breaths/min and SPO2 was 94% on room oxygen. The patient had fever with a body temperature of 38.8\\\\u00b0C. The patient does not have any known or documented cardiovascular risk factor: no history of tobacco consumption, dyslipidemia, diabetes or cardiac problems. She is allergic to amoxicillin, with an allergic reaction of a cutaneous rash and angioedema. She also has an intolerance to butylscopolamine, resulting in agitation and irritability. She cannot take metoclopramide as it once resulted in hypotension.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Rash, Urticaria, Rash maculo-papular, COVID-19, Rash vesicular, Rash macular, Urticarial dermatitis, COVID-19 pneumonia, Asymptomatic COVID-19, Angioedema, Rash erythematous, Rash maculovesicular, Necrosis, Urticaria papular, Urticaria physical, Idiopathic urticaria, Multipathogen PCR test, Death, COVID-19 immunisation, Erythema, Urticaria vesiculosa, Dermatitis bullous, Urticaria aquagenic, Rash papular, Mechanical urticaria, COVID-19 treatment, Coronavirus infection, Pyrexia, Urticaria chronic, Mucocutaneous rash, Blister, Papule, Oedema, Skin oedema, Necrosis ischaemic, Polymerase chain reaction, Enanthema, Rash morbilliform, Pruritus, Gangrene, Rash scarlatiniform, Rash pustular, SARS-CoV-2 test positive, Cytomegalovirus infection, Urticaria cholinergic, Eczema vesicular, SARS-CoV-2 carrier, Generalised oedema, Exposure to SARS-CoV-2, Rash papulosquamous\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653889.88315}
