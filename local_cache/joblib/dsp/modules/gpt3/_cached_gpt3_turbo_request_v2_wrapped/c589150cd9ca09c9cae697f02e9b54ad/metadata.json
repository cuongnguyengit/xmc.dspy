ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The potential benefits of corticosteroids for septic shock may depend on initial mortality risk. OBJECTIVE We determined associations between corticosteroids and outcomes in children with septic shock who were stratified by initial mortality risk. METHODS We conducted a retrospective analysis of an ongoing, multi-center pediatric septic shock clinical and biological database. Using a validated biomarker-based stratification tool (PERSEVERE), 496 subjects were stratified into three initial mortality risk strata (low, intermediate, and high). Subjects receiving corticosteroids during the initial 7 days of admission (n = 252) were compared to subjects who did not receive corticosteroids (n = 244). Logistic regression was used to model the effects of corticosteroids on 28-day mortality and complicated course, defined as death within 28 days or persistence of two or more organ failures at 7 days. RESULTS Subjects who received corticosteroids had greater organ failure burden, higher illness severity, higher mortality, and a greater requirement for vasoactive medications, compared to subjects who did not receive corticosteroids. PERSEVERE-based mortality risk did not differ between the two groups. For the entire cohort, corticosteroids were associated with increased risk of mortality (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.0, p = 0.004) and a complicated course (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.5, p = 0.012). Within each PERSEVERE-based stratum, corticosteroid administration was not associated with improved outcomes. Similarly, corticosteroid administration was not associated with improved outcomes among patients with no comorbidities, nor in groups of patients stratified by PRISM. CONCLUSIONS Risk stratified analysis failed to demonstrate any benefit from corticosteroids in this pediatric septic shock cohort. TEXT: Introduction The controversy surrounding corticosteroid use in septic shock has yielded multiple adult randomized controlled trials, yet their results are conflicting and a consensus has yet to be reached [1]\\\\u2013[6]. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend considering corticosteroid usage in patients with refractory shock, defined as those who continue to require vasopressors despite adequate fluid resuscitation [7]. However, physician practices surrounding adjunctive corticosteroid administration vary significantly [8], [9]. Practitioners must weigh the potential hemodynamic improvements seen with corticosteroids against the risks of diminished wound healing, gastrointestinal bleeding, hyperglycemia, and immune suppression [4], [6], [10].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Death, Septic shock, Sepsis, Disease progression, Condition aggravated, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Shock, Clinical death, Endotoxic shock, Toxic shock syndrome, Acute kidney injury, Renal impairment, Terminal state, Fatigue, Sudden death, Circulatory collapse, Cardiac arrest, Hypotension, Renal failure, Cardiogenic shock, Drug ineffective, General physical health deterioration, Sepsis syndrome, Toxic shock syndrome streptococcal, Disease recurrence, Malaise, Shock haemorrhagic, Foetal death, Bacteraemia, Toxic shock syndrome staphylococcal, Euthanasia, Bacterial sepsis, Death of relative, Death of companion, Cardiac death, Agonal death struggle, Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, Blood corticosterone, Neutropenic sepsis, Systemic bacterial infection, Stillbirth, Death neonatal, Febrile neutropenia, Premature baby death, Hypovolaemic shock, Disease risk factor, Nausea, Systemic infection, Witness of death, Chronic disease\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output. We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are directly expressed or implied. The article discusses the use of corticosteroids in pediatric septic shock and their association with outcomes. It mentions that subjects who received corticosteroids had a higher mortality rate and a greater requirement for vasoactive medications, which implies a potential worsening of the condition or the presence of adverse reactions. The article also specifically mentions risks associated with corticosteroid use, such as diminished wound healing, gastrointestinal bleeding, hyperglycemia, and immune suppression.\\\\n\\\\nReactions:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653338.6505268}
