ABSTRACT: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with inadequately controlled HNF1A maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) who was successfully transitioned from sulfonylurea therapy to once-weekly monotherapy with dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). More than a decade from diabetes diagnosis, she has maintained optimal glycemic control without hypoglycemia for >12 months while receiving GLP-1 RA therapy alone. This case illustrates the potential for successful use of GLP-1 RA monotherapy in patients with HNF1A MODY. TEXT: Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) accounts for at least 1% to 2% of diabetes cases. The various MODY phenotypes form part of a heterogenous group of monogenic diabetes phenotypes transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Individuals are often misdiagnosed as having type 1 or type 2 diabetes, depending on the age at diagnosis and clinical presentation. Along with mutations in the glucokinase gene, mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\\\\u237a (HNF1A) gene account for most cases [1]. Individuals with HNF1A MODY typically demonstrate marked sensitivity to sulfonylureas, which are recommended as first-line therapy [2]. However, hypoglycemia related to sulfonylurea use may become problematic in certain individuals. When added to the potential for weight gain with this class of medications, this raises the question of whether nonsulfonylurea therapies may have a role to play. Given the glucose-dependent mechanism of action and widespread efficacy of GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes, in addition to low hypoglycemia risk with use as monotherapy, beneficial effects on body weight, and evidence supporting cardiovascular benefit in type 2 diabetes, this class of medications holds potential that is yet to be fully explored in certain MODY phenotypes. To date, there are limited data on the use of GLP-1 RA in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY. One a short-term, 6-week clinical trial examined liraglutide as monotherapy, and several case reports have documented GLP-1 RA as adjunctive therapy [3, 4]. To our knowledge, no prior reports have addressed the use of weekly dulaglutide therapy in patients with confirmed HNF1A MODY or the long-term use of incretin monotherapy in this population. 1.

ABSTRACT: Over the last decades, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been widely used as the mainstay for treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal side effects, gastroesophageal reflux, and peptic ulcer disease. However, their safety profile has come into question recently after reports relating them to several side effects as well as kidney disease. Omeprazole, one of the mainly used PPIs, is almost entirely metabolized by the liver but the resulting metabolites are renally excreted. These metabolites may inhibit cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) reversibly, but as recent evidence suggests, they may also be involved in causing kidney disease. In the setting of renal dysfunction, these metabolites will not be excreted from the body and will accumulate further causing kidney damage and inhibiting CYP enzymes to a greater extent. Abnormally high serum prolactin levels leading to galactorrhea may be the result of such an accumulation. To our knowledge, there have been only three previously reported cases of PPI-induced galactorrhea in the literature but none in a kidney transplant recipient. In patients with established kidney disease and reduced glomerular filtration rate like kidney transplant recipients, the use of PPIs should be thoroughly assessed. Reduced clearance of their metabolites may lead to progression of the kidney disease and lead to more unwanted side effects. We present a case of a female kidney transplant recipient with worsening allograft function who presented with sudden galactorrhea and hyperprolactinemia while on a high-dose omeprazole for gastroesophageal reflux disease. TEXT: 1. Introduction Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been one of the most extensively used medications in clinical practice over the last thirty years. They have been the mainstay in the treatment of acid-related disorders and in 2015 were ranked in the top ten United States health-related expenditures [1, 2]. PPIs irreversibly inhibit the H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) in gastric parietal cells, blocking acid production, and are recommended as empiric therapy for patients suspected of having gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD) [3]. Omeprazole was the first drug approved in this class in 1989 and has been followed by five other PPIs including lansoprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, and the stereoisomeric compounds dexlansoprazole and esomeprazole [4]. Due to their good safety profile, in 2003, omeprazole was the first approved PPI for public over-the-counter (OTC) use for the short-term (two weeks) management of heartburn.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Renal disorder, Nephropathy, Hyperprolactinaemia, Galactorrhoea, Renal impairment, Macroprolactinaemia, Renal failure, Acute kidney injury, Chronic kidney disease, Blood prolactin increased, Hyperpituitarism, Nephropathy toxic, Tubulointerstitial nephritis, Glomerulonephropathy, Lactation disorder, Pituitary gonadotropin hyperfunction, Renal tubular disorder, CYP2C19 polymorphism, Urinary tract disorder, Nephrotic syndrome, Hyperglycaemia, Ectopic prolactin secretion, Vomiting, Lactation normal, Breast engorgement, CYP2B6 polymorphism, CYP2C9 polymorphism, Nausea, Suppressed lactation, CYP2D6 polymorphism, Chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder, Breast discharge, CYP3A4 polymorphism, Kidney fibrosis, CYP3A5 polymorphism, CYP1A2 polymorphism, Nephritic syndrome, Pituitary hyperplasia, Pituitary enlargement, Congenital renal disorder, Nipple enlargement, Hyperreactio luteinalis, Nephritis, Diabetic nephropathy, Hyperglucagonaemia, Blood prolactin abnormal, Pituitary-dependent Cushing\\'s syndrome, Galactostasis, Lactation puerperal increased, Nephrectasia\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653429.353452}
