ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Procalcitonin (PCT) is used as a biomarker for identifying the occurrence of sepsis. Previous studies have reported high levels of PCT with acetaminophen intoxication without evidence of infection. Here, we report two patients with acetaminophen intoxication with high levels of PCT without showing any symptoms of bacterial infection. This case study examined two unrelated patients with acetaminophen intoxication admitted to emergency at different times. The first patient was admitted to the emergency department after ingesting approximately 8000 mg (153.8 mg/kg) of acetaminophen. On admission, C-reactive protein (CRP), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), and glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT) were normal. PCT and acetaminophen levels were 31.89 ng/mL and below 0.5 \\\\u03bcg/mL, respectively. The second patient was admitted to the emergency department 8 h after ingesting \\\\u223c23,600 mg (280.6 mg/kg) of acetaminophen. By the second day of admission, GOT and GPT increased to 2508 and 1473 IU/L, respectively. PCT was 45.66 ng/mL with acetaminophen level at 116.9 \\\\u03bcg/mL. Both patients were clear of symptoms associated with bacterial infection. METHODS Acetaminophen intoxication. METHODS N-acetylcysteine was given intravenously to both patients for 20 h per protocol. RESULTS Both patients were discharged without complications. CONCLUSIONS Observations suggests that elevated levels of PCT in patients intoxicated with acetaminophen may be associated with involvement of other organs impacted by cytokine stimuli from sterile inflammation resulting from hepatic damage rather than PCT secretion directly caused by hepatic cell damage. TEXT: 1 Introduction Procalcitonin (PCT) is used as an effective biomarker in identifying sepsis as well as to help determine the duration of antibiotics used in a patient.[1\\\\u20135] However, recent studies have shown that bacterial infection may not be the only cause resulting in elevated PCT levels. PCT levels can be elevated in patients experiencing acute liver failure (ALF) associated with acetaminophen intoxication without infection.[5\\\\u20137] This demonstrates that a measure of PCT does not always correlate with the probability of infection.[5\\\\u20137] One study has documented extremely elevated levels of PCT in children with ALF due to acetaminophen intoxication without evidence of bacterial infection that could not be explained by drug induced liver cell injury and/or hidden bacterial infection.[5] Although the exact mechanisms of increased PCT levels in acetaminophen intoxication were unclear, the results of these previous studies suggest that high PCT levels in acetaminophen intoxication might be associated with involvement of other organs affected by cytokine stimuli in addition to liver cell damage.[5\\\\u20137]\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Liver injury, Drug-induced liver injury, Toxicity to various agents, Hepatotoxicity, Hepatocellular injury, Traumatic liver injury, Procalcitonin increased, Hepatic failure, Liver disorder, Mixed liver injury, Sepsis, Acute hepatic failure, Hepatitis, Procalcitonin abnormal, Hepatic necrosis, Cholestatic liver injury, Hepatic encephalopathy, Hepatic rupture, Acute kidney injury, Blood calcitonin increased, Hypercalcitoninaemia, Hepatic function abnormal, Hepatic lesion, Hypercalcaemia, Hepatitis toxic, Hepatitis fulminant, Hepatocellular damage neonatal, Ischaemic hepatitis, Liver contusion, Procalcitonin decreased, Liver transplant, Procalcitonin, Hepatic ischaemia, Hepatitis acute, Coma hepatic, Blood calcitonin abnormal, Immune-mediated hepatic disorder, Bacteraemia, Hepatic steatosis, Procalcitonin normal, Immune-mediated hepatitis, Hepatic haemorrhage, Hepatic siderosis, Hepatobiliary procedural complication, Ectopic calcitonin production, Hepatic enzyme increased, C-reactive protein increased, Acute on chronic liver failure, Hepatic haematoma, Parathyroid hormone-related protein increased\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653495.1354012}
