ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND To date, no biomarkers exist to predict response or resistance to immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recent approaches to classify HCC into different immunological states revealed a negative correlation between Wnt/\\\\u00df-catenin activation and immunogenicity and T-cell infiltration. If these \\\\\"cold\\\\\" tumors with primary resistance to checkpoint inhibition (CPI) may benefit from dual treatment of CPI and anti-angiogenic therapy has not been proved. METHODS Here, we describe the case of a male patient with metastatic HCC. After failure of standard of care treatment with lenvatinib, sorafenib and ramucirumab fourth-line systemic therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab were applied leading to a phenomenal response. Immunohistochemical evaluations were compatible with Wnt/\\\\u00df-catenin pathway activation and accompanying low T-cell infiltration as well as low PD-L1 score. CONCLUSIONS Patients with Wnt/\\\\u00df-catenin activation may benefit from combination therapy with atezolizumab and bevacizumab regardless of potential predictive markers for immune checkpoint inhibition. TEXT: pmc1 INTRODUCTION The hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is responsible for an increasing number of cancer\\\\u2010related deaths worldwide and is usually associated with liver cirrhosis. 1 Growing evidence indicates metabolic syndrome related to diabetes and obesity as mounting risk factors for HCC in the Western world. 2 While in patients with liver cirrhosis a multistep progression from cirrhotic nodules to HCC occurs, the mechanism is more heterogeneous in noncirrhotic patients. There, chronic infection with HBV, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or the malignant transformation of hepatocellular adenoma are involved in cancer development. Preclinically, two major molecular subtypes of HCC exist: a proliferation and nonproliferation class. The latter one is often characterized by an activation of the WNT signaling pathway based on the mutation of CTNNB1 (encoding for \\\\u03b2\\\\u2010catenin). CTNNB1 and TERT mutations are frequently detected in liver adenomas and are marked by a particularly high rate of malignant progression. Besides tumor cell\\\\u2010specific alterations the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been increasingly recognized as modulator of tumor initiation and progression. According to the immune status in the TME, the HCC can be classified into three subgroups: immune, immune intermediate, and immune excluded tumors. The immune subtype demonstrated immune cell infiltration and tumors of the immune excluded class showed Wnt/\\\\u03b2\\\\u2010catenin pathway activation and a lack of infiltrating T\\\\u2010lymphocytes. 2 CASE REPORT\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Anti-VGKC antibody, Anti-insulin receptor antibody, Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody, Anti-erythropoietin antibody, Anti-VGCC antibody, Anti-transglutaminase antibody, Inhibiting antibodies, Monoclonal antibody immunoconjugate therapy, Beta-2 glycoprotein antibody, Anti-aquaporin-4 antibody, Rheumatoid factor, Neutralising antibodies, Anti-GAD antibody, Monoclonal antibody unconjugated therapy, Monoclonal antibody radioconjugate therapy, Rheumatoid factor negative, Anti-neuronal antibody, Monoclonal antibody chemoimmunoconjugate therapy, Anti-exosome complex antibody, Anti-IA2 antibody, Anti-interferon antibody, Anti-zinc transporter 8 antibody, Antiphospholipid antibodies, Anti-insulin antibody, Anti factor V antibody, Anti-muscle specific kinase antibody, Anti-islet cell antibody, Anti-VGKC antibody negative, Anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody negative, Anti-erythrocyte antibody, Alpha-1 anti-trypsin, Anti-epithelial antibody, Anti-erythropoietin antibody negative, Antigliadin antibody, Inhibiting antibodies negative, Antimitochondrial antibody, Monoclonal antibody toxin conjugate therapy, Anti-NMDA antibody, Anti-RNA polymerase III antibody, Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, Rheumatoid factor decreased, Anti-vimentin antibody, Anti-actin antibody, Anti-thrombin antibody, Human antichimeric antibody negative, Anti-insulin receptor antibody decreased, Rheumatoid arthritis, Antiacetylcholine receptor antibody, Chest pain, Anti-basal ganglia antibody\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653989.8308902}
