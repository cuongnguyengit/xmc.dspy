The vacancy mentions a degree in \\\\\"Production Mechanical Electrical Marine Engineering (or similar)\\\\\" and the candidate might be \\\\\"newly educated.\\\\\" This suggests that the job requires a foundational understanding of engineering principles, particularly in the fields mentioned. Since the candidate might be newly educated, we can infer that the job may not require extensive experience but rather a solid educational background in the relevant engineering disciplines. We should look for skills that are related to mechanical, electrical, and marine engineering, as well as general engineering competencies that a recent graduate might possess.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: marine engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, operate mechanical equipment of ships, manage ship electrical systems, operate ship equipment, maintain shipboard machinery, maritime transportation technology, offshore constructions and facilities, provide support in vessel machinery systems\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: SQL experience is a plus but not required\\\\n\\\\nOptions: SQL, SQL Server, database, MySQL, use databases, PostgreSQL, Oracle Relational Database, data warehouse, database management systems, use query languages, query languages, manage database, Microsoft Access, operate relational database management system, database development tools, maintain database, data analytics, Teradata Database, CA Datacom/DB, business intelligence, Solidity, SPARQL, search databases, database quality standards, perform data mining, perform records management, data models, data mining, Drupal, maintain database performance, create data models, NoSQL, create database diagrams, manage quantitative data, implement data warehousing techniques, develop data processing applications, PHP, accounting, C#, design database scheme, SAP Data Services, DB2, use logic programming, manage data, data storage, balance database resources, SAS Data Management, perform data analysis, use accounting systems, use data processing techniques\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as beneficial for the job vacancy. The vacancy mentions \\\\\"SQL experience is a plus but not required,\\\\\" which suggests that while SQL skills are advantageous, they are not a mandatory requirement for the job. Therefore, we should focus on skills related to SQL and databases, as these are the most relevant to the statement provided.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: Skills: SQL, use databases, use query languages, query languages, manage database, database management systems, operate relational database management system, maintain database, create data models, manage data\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: For this project we seek a researcher with experience in mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics ( preferentially phosphoproteomics ) as well as molecular biology ( vector construction protein synthesis in E .\\\\n\\\\nOptions: molecular biology, biological chemistry, biology, molecular and cellular immunology, biophysics, mass spectrometry, cytopathology, biomedical science, biotechnology, immunology, medical genetics, molecular gastronomy, explain the molecular basis of a disease to patients, enzymatic processing, transcription methods, radiobiology, undertake research in medical genetics, animal biology, microbiology-bacteriology, clinical biochemistry, biomedicine, evolutionary biology, embryology, transcreation, conduct genome research, genetic engineering, diagnose genetic diseases, clinical biology, immunohaematology, thanatology, liaise with genetic laboratories, organic chemistry, biostatistics, tissue cytogenetics, histology, medical mycology, pathology, biomarkers, pharmacology, interpret laboratory data in medical genetics, biomedical engineering, mycology, collect biological data, microscopic techniques, alkylation, marine biology, biological haematology, genetics, virology, stem cells\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed in the job vacancy snippet. The vacancy specifically mentions \\\\\"experience in mass spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics (preferentially phosphoproteomics)\\\\\" and \\\\\"molecular biology (vector construction, protein synthesis in E.\\\\\" This indicates that the job requires specialized knowledge in proteomics, particularly mass spectrometry and phosphoproteomics, as well as practical skills in molecular biology techniques such as vector construction and protein synthesis.
