ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischaemic stroke patients with pre-interventional intracranial haemorrhage following intravenous thrombolysis. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Data on outcome of endovascular treatment in patients with acute ischaemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion suffering from intravenous thrombolysis-associated intracranial haemorrhage prior to mechanical thrombectomy remain scarce. Addressing this subject, we report our multicentre experience. METHODS A retrospective analysis of consecutive acute ischaemic stroke patients treated with mechanical thrombectomy due to large vessel occlusion despite the pre-interventional occurrence of intravenous thrombolysis-associated intracranial haemorrhage was performed at five tertiary care centres between January 2010-September 2020. Baseline demographics, aetiology of stroke and intracranial haemorrhage, angiographic outcome assessed by the Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score and clinical outcome evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale at 90 days were recorded. RESULTS In total, six patients were included in the study. Five individuals demonstrated cerebral intraparenchymal haemorrhage on pre-interventional imaging; in one patient additional subdural haematoma was observed and one patient suffered from isolated subarachnoid haemorrhage. All patients except one were treated by the \\'drip-and-ship\\' paradigm. Successful reperfusion was achieved in 4/6 (67%) individuals. In 5/6 (83%) patients, the pre-interventional intracranial haemorrhage had aggravated in post-interventional computed tomography with space-occupying effect. Overall, five patients had died during the hospital stay. The clinical outcome of the survivor was modified Rankin Scale=4 at 90 days follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Mechanical thrombectomy in patients with intravenous thrombolysis-associated intracranial haemorrhage is technically feasible. The clinical outcome of this subgroup of stroke patients, however, appears to be devastating with high mortality and only carefully selected patients might benefit from endovascular treatment. TEXT: pmcBackground Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in combination with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) is the standard treatment for patients suffering from acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) due to intracranial large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation.1,2 The particular benefit of IVT in these patients is unknown. As a result, various randomised controlled studies are currently being conducted to determine if MT without IVT is equally effective (SWIFT-DIRECT, NCT03192332; MR CLEAN NO IV, ISRCTN80619088; DIRECT MT, NCT03469206). Recently, the randomised DIRECT-MT trial in China indicated that MT was noninferior to the combined treatment. 3 However, the ongoing SKIP trial in Japan could not establish that skipping IVT was noninferior to the combined approach but was at least associated with a lower risk of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). 4\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Cerebral haemorrhage, Subdural haematoma, Subarachnoid haemorrhage, Haemorrhage intracranial, Subdural haemorrhage, Thrombectomy, Spinal subdural haematoma, Thrombocytopenia, Modified Rankin score, Intraventricular haemorrhage, Subarachnoid haematoma, Central nervous system haemorrhage, Haemorrhagic cerebral infarction, Subdural haematoma evacuation, Basal ganglia haemorrhage, Thromboembolectomy, Cerebellar haemorrhage, Intracranial haematoma, Spinal subdural haemorrhage, Cerebral haematoma, Thalamus haemorrhage, Brain stem haemorrhage, Extradural haematoma, Subdural haemorrhage neonatal, Spinal epidural haematoma, Traumatic intracranial haematoma, Cerebral haemorrhage neonatal, Spinal cord haematoma, Tumour thrombectomy, Cerebral microhaemorrhage, Spinal subarachnoid haemorrhage, Intraventricular haemorrhage neonatal, Haematoma, Cerebral artery perforation, Putamen haemorrhage, Haemorrhagic stroke, Subarachnoid haemorrhage neonatal, Periventricular haemorrhage neonatal, Basal ganglia haematoma, Epidural haemorrhage, Cerebral cyst haemorrhage, Cerebellar haematoma, Pituitary haemorrhage, Cerebellar microhaemorrhage, Traumatic haematoma, Traumatic intracranial haemorrhage, Brain stem microhaemorrhage, Extraischaemic cerebral haematoma, Disseminated intravascular coagulation, Meningorrhagia\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706654016.546373}
