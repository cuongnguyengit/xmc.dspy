ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Mucormycosis-unusual cause of lower GI bleeding: A rare case report. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Mucormycosis is a rare systemic fungal infection seen in immune-compromised patients. Gastrointestinal tract involvement is not usual. METHODS A 36 years female presented with fever and progressive bilateral leg swelling for 25 days. She was diagnosed as nephrotic syndrome and started on methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. She developed hematochezia during hospital stay. On colonoscopy, ulcero-proliferative lesion was noted in caecum. Histopathology examination has confirmed it as mucormycosis of Caecum. CONCLUSIONS Mucormycosis is an opportunistic angioinvasive disease caused by fungus zygomycosis it is a rare disease and often manifests as a life-threatening condition in immune-compromised patient. Invasion by fungal hyphae leads to arterial thrombosis, tissue infarction, hemorrhage and, necrosis. Diagnosis is confirmed by histopathological examination and culture. It is usually treated by the anti-fungal drug- liposomal amphotericin and surgical debridement. CONCLUSIONS Mucormycosis is a fatal systemic fungal infection, which can present as lower gastrointestinal bleeding in immunocompromised patients. TEXT: pmc1 Introduction Mucormycosis is a systemic fungal infection caused by the mucor or rhizopus that belongs to the Mucoraceae family. It is a ubiquitous saprophytic mold which grows in soil and organic matter and produces hyphae after inhalation or ingestion. It represents the third most common angioinvasive fungal infection following candidiasis and aspergillosis [1]. It is common in immune-compromised patients like Diabetes Mellitus, Malignancies, HIV/AIDS, Corticosteroid/Immunosuppressant therapy. There are six types of mucormycosis, namely: rhinocerebral, pulmonary, cutaneous, gastrointestinal tract, disseminated, and miscellaneous (endocarditis, osteomyelitis, renal) [2], [3]. Stomach is the most common site of involvement in gastrointestinal tract (GI) followed by colon and ileum [4]. GI symptoms occur due to colonization of fungus leading to mucosal ulceration, infiltration and vascular invasion. Clinical progression is rapid and almost universally fatal if untreated [5]. It is diagnosed by histopathological examination or tissue culture [6]. It is treated by systemic antifungal drug and surgical debridement or resection. This case report has been reported in line with the SCARE Criteria [7]. 2 Case presentation We report a case of 39 years lady who presented with fever for one and half month, sore throat followed by swelling of bilateral lower limb 25 days back. Swelling gradually progressed to involve face. Then she noticed cola-colored urine with gradual decrease in urine output. She also gave a history of evening rise in temperature associated with chills and rigor. She gave no any past medical, surgical, psychosocial and family history.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Mucormycosis, Haematochezia, Nephrotic syndrome, Drug ineffective, Lower gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Proteinuria, Debridement, Pulmonary mucormycosis, Diarrhoea, Intestinal haemorrhage, Fungal infection, Condition aggravated, Burn debridement, Large intestinal haemorrhage, Rectal haemorrhage, Disseminated mucormycosis, Gastrointestinal mucormycosis, Nephropathy, Gastrointestinal disorder, Congenital nephrotic syndrome, Rhinocerebral mucormycosis, Cutaneous mucormycosis, Diarrhoea haemorrhagic, Treatment failure, Small intestinal haemorrhage, Respiratory tract infection fungal, Disease progression, Aspergillus infection, Histology, Joint debridement, Fracture debridement, Nephropathy toxic, Pulmonary mycosis, Bone debridement, Intestinal haematoma, Haemorrhage, Renal impairment, Paraneoplastic nephrotic syndrome, Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Colonic haematoma, Therapy non-responder, Anal haemorrhage, Candida infection, Acute kidney injury, Upper respiratory fungal infection, Proctitis haemorrhagic, Enterocolitis haemorrhagic, Haemorrhoidal haemorrhage, Decreased immune responsiveness\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706654001.870729}
