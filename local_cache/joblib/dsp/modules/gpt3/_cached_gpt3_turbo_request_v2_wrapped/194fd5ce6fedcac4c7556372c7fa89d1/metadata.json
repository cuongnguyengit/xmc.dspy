ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: A 71-year-old woman was admitted for the treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma of the ileum. She had been taking lansoprazole but was switched to vonoprazan due to epigastric discomfort. Three weeks after starting vonoprazan intake, she had a convulsive seizure, and a blood test showed hypomagnesiemia. The cause of hypomagnesemia was considered to be malabsorption of magnesium from the intestinal tract associated with vonoprazan. After discontinuation of vonoprazan, the magnesium level quickly recovered, and the seizures did not relapse. It is important to consider the risk of hypomagnesemia in patients taking vonoprazan, even for a short period of time. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Vonoprazan fumarate (Vonoprazan), a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), is a gastric acid secretion inhibitor with a faster onset and longer duration of effect than conventional proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), and it is widely used in the treatment of reflux esophagitis and eradication of Helicobacter pylori (1,2). Hypomagnesemia is a side effect associated with PPIs, and more than 40 cases have been reported since 2006 (3). At present, there have been no case reports of hypomagnesemia caused by vonoprazan. In addition, most of the case reports of PPI-induced hypomagnesemia involved patients who had been taking PPIs for more than one year (4), and there are few case reports of hypomagnesemia caused by PPIs taken for a short period of time. We herein report a case of convulsive seizures due to hypomagnesemia that occurred just three weeks after the start of vonoprazan administration. Case Report A 71-year-old woman visited her previous physician for a detailed examination of anemia, and computed tomography (CT) showed wall thickening of the terminal ileum and multiple lymphadenopathy in the abdominal cavity. The patient underwent laparoscopic ileocecal resection, and the pathological diagnosis was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Subsequently, she was admitted to our hospital for a further investigation and treatment, and THP-COP-R therapy (pirarubicin 30 mg/m2, cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2, vincristine 1 mg/m2, predonisone 40 mg/body, rituximab 375 mg/m2) was started. The patient was taking lansoprazole to prevent gastric mucosal injury but was switched to vonoprazan because of epigastiric discomfort and heartburn. Afterwards she experienced no further particular symptoms, but when she visited the outpatient clinic due to a poor physical condition three weeks after starting vonoprazan, she had a convulsive seizure with loss of consciousness and left co-movement. The seizure resolved spontaneously within about three minutes, and her level of consciousness gradually recovered. The patient was admitted to the hospital for follow-up and to investigate the cause of her first convulsive seizure.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Seizure, Hypomagnesaemia, Epilepsy, Generalised tonic-clonic seizure, Hyponatraemia, Hypokalaemia, Hypocalcaemia, Partial seizures, Seizure like phenomena, Status epilepticus, Hypermagnesaemia, Epileptic aura, Convulsions local, Electrolyte imbalance, Blood magnesium decreased, Change in seizure presentation, Tonic convulsion, Thrombocytopenia, Hyperkalaemia, Gelastic seizure, Clonic convulsion, Blood potassium decreased, Atonic seizures, Tonic clonic movements, Generalised onset non-motor seizure, Magnesium deficiency, Urine magnesium decreased, Blood electrolytes decreased, Primary familial hypomagnesaemia, Uncinate fits, Simple partial seizures, Autonomic seizure, Focal dyscognitive seizures, Hypermagnesuria, Alkalosis hypokalaemic, Metabolic acidosis, Seizure cluster, Drop attacks, Petit mal epilepsy, Partial seizures with secondary generalisation, Temporal lobe epilepsy, Seizure anoxic, Convulsive threshold lowered, Urine electrolytes decreased, Urine potassium decreased, Neonatal seizure, Electrolyte depletion, Magnesium metabolism disorder, Convulsion in childhood, Febrile convulsion\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output. We need to identify the adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied in the article. The article discusses a case of a 71-year-old woman who experienced a convulsive seizure due to hypomagnesemia after taking vonoprazan. The hypomagnesemia is attributed to malabsorption of magnesium from the intestinal tract associated with vonoprazan. The article does not mention epilepsy, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, or any other specific type of seizure other than the convulsive seizure due to hypomagnesemia. It also does not mention any other electrolyte imbalances or seizure-related conditions that are not directly related to the hypomagnesemia\\\\n\\\\nReactions:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706654004.5440216}
