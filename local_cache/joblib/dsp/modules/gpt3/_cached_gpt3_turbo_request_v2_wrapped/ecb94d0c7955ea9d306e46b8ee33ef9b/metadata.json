ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Background and Objectives: Sugammadex is a modified \\\\u03b3-cyclodextrin largely used to prevent postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade induced by neuromuscular aminosteroid blocking agents. Although Sugammadex is considered more efficacious and safer than other drugs, such as Neostigmine, significant and serious complications after its administration, such as hypersensitivity, anaphylaxis and, more recently, severe cardiac events, are reported. Case presentation: In this report, we describe the case of an 80-year-old male with no medical history of cardiovascular disease who was scheduled for percutaneous nephrolithotripsy under general anesthesia. The intraoperative course was uneventful; however, the patient developed a rapid and severe hypotension, asystole and cardiac arrest after Sugammadex administration. Spontaneous cardiac activity and hemodynamic stability was restored with pharmacological therapy and chest compression. The patient was stabilized and discharged uneventfully on postoperative day 10. Conclusions: The potential causes of cardiac arrest after Sugammadex administration have been carefully considered, yet all indications point to Sugammadex as the direct causative agent. On the basis of laboratory and clinical tests, we can exclude among the cause of bradycardia, Kounis syndrome, acute myocardial infarction, coronary spasm and other arrhythmias, but not anaphylaxis. Although Sugammadex is considered an increasingly important option in the prevention of postoperative residual neuromuscular blockade, anesthesiologists should consider it a causative agent of cardiac arrest during surgery. This case highlights the necessity of increased pharmacovigilance and further studies to examine Sugammadex safety and mechanism through which it may cause severe bradycardia, hypotension and cardiac arrest. TEXT: 1. Introduction The modified \\\\u03b3-cyclodextrin Sugammadex is widely used to antagonize the post-operative residual neuromuscular blockade induced by neuromuscular aminosteroid blocking agents (NMBAs), such as Rocuronium bromide or Vecuronium bromide, used in adult anesthesia to ease endotracheal intubation, mechanical ventilation and surgical access. In detail, Sugammadex binds NMBA clearing nicotinic receptors, quickly reversing residual neuromuscular blockade and reducing the risk of postoperative respiratory complications.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypotension, Bradycardia, Cardiac arrest, Acute myocardial infarction, Anaphylactic reaction, Myocardial infarction, Tachycardia, Arrhythmia, Blood pressure decreased, Kounis syndrome, Respiratory failure, Anaphylactic shock, Arteriospasm coronary, Bradyarrhythmia, Sinus bradycardia, Anaphylactoid reaction, Cardio-respiratory arrest, Palpitations, Hypokalaemia, Ventricular asystole, Anaphylactoid shock, Blood pressure systolic decreased, Central bradycardia, Mean arterial pressure decreased, Acute cardiac event, Orthostatic hypotension, Acute coronary syndrome, Blood pressure ambulatory decreased, Shock, Hypersensitivity, Sinus tachycardia, Heart rate decreased, Anaphylactic transfusion reaction, Hypertension, Angina pectoris, Heart rate irregular, Diastolic hypotension, Procedural hypotension, Blood pressure diastolic decreased, Dehydration, Blood pressure orthostatic decreased, Post procedural hypotension, Septic shock, Dyspnoea, Silent myocardial infarction, Tachyarrhythmia, Pulse volume decreased, Chest pain, Heart rate variability decreased, Acute kidney injury\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653903.0958433}
