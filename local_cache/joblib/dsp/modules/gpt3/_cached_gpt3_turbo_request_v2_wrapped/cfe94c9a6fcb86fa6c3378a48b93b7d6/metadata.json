ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Capnocytophaga gingivalis Bacteremia After Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Immunocompromised Patient. ABSTRACT: Odontogenic bacteremia, most commonly involving gram-positive oral flora, can result from daily self-care practices or professional dental procedures. Though usually transient and quickly cleared by the immune system, the presence of periodontal disease increases the frequency of exposure and risk of persistence of oral-systemic infections. Comorbidities such as asplenia, alcoholism, and immunocompromise increase the risk of complications of hematogenous spread and severe systemic illness. Capnocytophaga is a genus of anaerobic fastidious gram-negative bacilli, which is a common member of human oral flora, and its density is proportional to mass of dental plaques and periodontal diseases. Capnocytophaga spp that colonize humans are less virulent and are uncommon causes of bacteremia when compared with the Capnocytophaga typical of canines. C gingivalis has been rarely reported as a cause of disease in immunocompromised or immunocompetent hosts. In this article, we present a case of an immunocompromised 70-year-old man with poor oral hygiene, on methotrexate and prednisone for rheumatoid arthritis and sarcoidosis, who was admitted for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation and developed C gingivalis bacteremia and septic shock after an episode of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Poor oral hygiene in our patient is believed to have increased his risk as an immunocompromised patient to developing C gingivalis bacteremia. This case highlights the importance of oral care in immunocompromised patients especially while hospitalized, and those about to receive transplant, chemotherapy, or on immune modulators. TEXT: Introduction Bacteria of the genus Capnocytophaga are anaerobic or microaerophilic, fastidious, and fusiform gram-negative bacillus that are part of oral flora of humans, dogs, and cats. Capnocytophaga gingivalis is one of 6 identified human colonist species found in adults and children. So far C canimorsus and C cynodegmi are the 2 species identified as part of animal oral flora.1-3\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Septic shock, Sepsis, Transplant, Chemotherapy, Shock, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Endotoxic shock, Drug ineffective, Toxic shock syndrome, Transplant rejection, Acute kidney injury, Capnocytophaga sepsis, Organ transplant, Reversible airways obstruction, Chemotherapy single agent systemic, Obstructive airways disorder, Circulatory collapse, Prophylactic chemotherapy, Chemotherapy multiple agents systemic, Regional chemotherapy, Hypotension, Bronchial obstruction, Cardiogenic shock, Poor personal hygiene, Poor dental condition, Sepsis syndrome, Toxic shock syndrome streptococcal, Chemotherapy side effect prophylaxis, Febrile neutropenia, Shock haemorrhagic, Bacteraemia, Toxic shock syndrome staphylococcal, Chemotherapy toxicity attenuation, Pneumonia, Organ donor, Bacterial sepsis, Immunosuppression, Capnocytophaga infection, Chemotherapy extravasation management, Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, Solid organ transplant, Transplant evaluation, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Neutropenic sepsis, Systemic bacterial infection, Delayed engraftment, Treatment failure, Infection in an immunocompromised host, Infective exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653975.6792688}
