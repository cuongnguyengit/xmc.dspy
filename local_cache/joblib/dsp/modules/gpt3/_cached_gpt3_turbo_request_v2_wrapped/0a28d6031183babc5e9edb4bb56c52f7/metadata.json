ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection.

ABSTRACT: Melioidosis is a bacterial infection caused by a Gram-negative bacillus Burkholderia pseudomallei, prevalent in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. Sri Lanka is situated in the endemic belt of melioidosis. Melioidosis has a wide spectrum of clinical presentations and results in high mortality rates in severe infection. Case Report. We report a 54-year-old previously healthy Sri Lankan farmer who presented with septicemia following a cut injury to the right leg while working in a paddy field. Initially, he had mild wound sepsis, and later, his condition deteriorated rapidly. The patient required organ support later for cardiovascular instability, acute liver failure, acute kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and coagulopathy. The patient\\'s blood culture was negative on the admission day, and the repeated blood culture taken at the ICU was contaminated with a commensal flora initially and later isolated Burkholderia pseudomallei. Although wound swab culture taken on the first day isolated an organism, it took six days to identify it as Burkholderia pseudomallei. The patient succumbed to severe melioidosis leading to a severe sepsis and multiorgan failure in spite of treatment with meropenem. This case report highlights the importance of considering melioidosis as a differential diagnosis when a patient comes with risk factors for melioidosis. TEXT: 1. Introduction Melioidosis is an infection caused by Burkholderia pseudomallei which is a Gram-negative, oxidase-positive, aerobic, non-spore-forming motile bacillus that is found in soil and water. Melioidosis is common in the tropical and subtropical zone between 30\\\\u00b0N and 30\\\\u00b0S [1]. Melioidosis is considered as endemic in Sri Lanka. There are three modes of transmission of this agent. They are inhalation, ingestion, and direct inoculation. Person to person, sexual, perinatal, vertical, and nosocomial transmission have also been reported [2, 3]. Clinical presentation of melioidosis infection ranges from an asymptomatic state to rapidly severe sepsis [2]. It also has a chronic and relapsing course and can remain dormant for long periods [2]. Polysaccharide capsule and lipopolysaccharide of the bacteria are resistant to compliment-mediated killing, which increases its virulence [2, 3]. Severe infection is common among people with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, renal disease, liver disease, alcohol consumption, and thalassemia. Occupational exposure to surface water and mud in the form of agriculture, farming, fishing, gardening, land surveying, building construction, and manual labouring are risk factors for melioidosis [4, 5]. A study conducted in Sri Lanka reported melioidosis in Sri Lanka has wide geographical distribution and it is common in rice-growing rural areas [1].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Acute kidney injury, Sepsis, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Diabetes mellitus, Acute hepatic failure, Coagulopathy, Septic shock, Renal failure, Renal impairment, Liver disorder, Anaemia, Hepatic failure, Neutropenia, Renal disorder, Thrombocytopenia, Respiratory failure, Nephropathy, Febrile neutropenia, Haemodynamic instability, Acute respiratory failure, Drug-induced liver injury, Thalassaemia, Hepatic function abnormal, Thalassaemia minor, Neutropenic sepsis, Respiratory distress, Disseminated intravascular coagulation, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Thalassaemia alpha, Bacterial sepsis, Bacteraemia, Thalassaemia beta, Hepatitis, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Organ failure, Acute on chronic liver failure, Alcohol use, Burkholderia pseudomallei infection, Hepatobiliary disease, Agranulocytosis, Acute lung injury, Liver injury, Pseudomonas infection, Haemoglobin E-thalassaemia disease, Hepatic lesion, Hepatotoxicity, Prerenal failure, Delta-beta thalassaemia, Hepatitis acute\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706654021.4843893}
