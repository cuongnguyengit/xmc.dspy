ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Melphalan flufenamide (melflufen) is a first-in-class peptide-drug conjugate that targets aminopeptidases and rapidly and selectively releases alkylating agents into tumor cells. The phase II HORIZON trial evaluated the efficacy of melflufen plus dexamethasone in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), a population with an important unmet medical need. Patients with RRMM refractory to pomalidomide and/or an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody received melflufen 40 mg intravenously on day 1 of each 28-day cycle plus once weekly oral dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg (20 mg in patients older than 75 years). The primary end point was overall response rate (partial response or better) assessed by the investigator and confirmed by independent review. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety. The primary analysis is complete with long-term follow-up ongoing. Of 157 patients (median age 65 years; median five prior lines of therapy) enrolled and treated, 119 patients (76%) had triple-class-refractory disease, 55 (35%) had extramedullary disease, and 92 (59%) were refractory to previous alkylator therapy. The overall response rate was 29% in the all-treated population, with 26% in the triple-class-refractory population. In the all-treated population, median duration of response was 5.5 months, median progression-free survival was 4.2 months, and median overall survival was 11.6 months at a median follow-up of 14 months. Grade \\\\u2265 3 treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 96% of patients, most commonly neutropenia (79%), thrombocytopenia (76%), and anemia (43%). Pneumonia (10%) was the most common grade 3/4 nonhematologic event. Thrombocytopenia and bleeding (both grade 3/4 but fully reversible) occurred concomitantly in four patients. GI events, reported in 97 patients (62%), were predominantly grade 1/2 (93%); none were grade 4. Melflufen plus dexamethasone showed clinically meaningful efficacy and a manageable safety profile in patients with heavily pretreated RRMM, including those with triple-class-refractory and extramedullary disease. TEXT: pmcINTRODUCTION Despite the introduction of novel therapies and regimens that have improved outcomes in multiple myeloma (MM),1,2 almost all patients will relapse.1,3 After relapse, treatment choice is usually determined by the class of and response to previous treatment and patient characteristics.2,3 Although class switching is generally prioritized, this is becoming increasingly difficult, not least because novel agents are commonly administered in combination in earlier treatment lines, resulting in disease resistant to multiple drug classes as early as second-line therapy.2,3 CONTEXT Key Objective\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Thrombocytopenia, Neutropenia, Anaemia, Pneumonia, Febrile neutropenia, Leukopenia, Pancytopenia, Haemorrhage, Pneumonitis, Platelet count decreased, Gastrointestinal disorder, Agranulocytosis, Haemoglobin decreased, Neutrophil count decreased, Bone marrow failure, Lung consolidation, Organising pneumonia, Granulocytopenia, Diarrhoea, Immune thrombocytopenia, Cytopenia, Gastrointestinal haemorrhage, Deficiency anaemia, Thrombocytopenic purpura, Neutropenic sepsis, Epistaxis, White blood cell count decreased, Neutrophil percentage decreased, Microcytic anaemia, Thrombocytosis, Pneumonia bacterial, Extravasation blood, Idiopathic neutropenia, Lymphopenia, Blood urine, Normocytic anaemia, Cyclic neutropenia, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, Sepsis, Autoimmune neutropenia, Parasitic pneumonia, Anaemia of chronic disease, Band neutrophil count decreased, Neutrophil function disorder, Haemoptysis, Granulocyte count decreased, Interstitial lung disease, Haematochezia, Normochromic normocytic anaemia, Normochromic anaemia\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
