ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

ABSTRACT: To report a rare case of primary orbital natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma without nasal lesions but with cerebrospinal fluid involvement. A 73-year-old woman was referred to the uveitis clinic with suspected unilateral acute uveitis in her right eye and a right orbital tumor. Epstein-Barr virus DNA was detected in the aqueous humor in her right eye, and orbital biopsy revealed the presence of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal type. Positron emission tomography showed significant 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the right orbit, with no other signs of systemic involvement. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis demonstrated lymphoma cell infiltration. She was diagnosed with stage IV ENKTL and treated with orbital radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy, with subsequent remission. However, the lymphoma relapsed in her left vitreous at 10 months after therapy, suggesting metastasis of lymphoma cells to the contralateral eye via the vitreous and cerebrospinal fluid. A few cases of ocular-tissue ENKTL have been reported, mostly involving invasion or dissemination of primary nasal lesions; in contrast, primary orbital and intraocular ENKTL has rarely been reported. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a primary orbital ENKTL metastasizing to the vitreous of the contralateral eye. Although ENKTL is rare in the orbit and intraocular tissues, it should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis in patients with orbital tumors or intraocular inflammation resistant to steroid therapy because ENKTL has a very poor prognosis in the advanced stage. TEXT: 1 Introduction Lymphomas are the most common type of primary orbital malignant tumors. Most orbital lymphomas are non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphomas, such as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas, which have a relatively good prognosis, while T-cell and natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphomas are extremely rare.1,2 Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal type, formerly known as lethal midline granuloma, angiocentric T-cell lymphoma, or polymorphic reticulosis, is an uncommon disease that typically arises from the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.2,3 While most NK/T-cell lymphomas in ocular tissues occur as an invasion or dissemination of nasal ENKTL, a few cases of primary orbital or intraocular ENKTL have been reported.3,4 Here we report an extremely rare case of primary orbital NKTCL that metastasized to the contralateral eye during the follow-up period, presumably via the vitreous and cerebrospinal fluid. 2 Case report\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Malignant neoplasm progression, Metastasis, Second primary malignancy, Metastatic neoplasm, Angiocentric lymphoma, Disease progression, Chemotherapy single agent systemic, Chemotherapy multiple agents systemic, Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, Radiotherapy to eye, Brachytherapy to eye, Chemotherapy, Lymphocytic infiltration, Histiocytic medullary reticulosis, T-cell lymphoma, Regional chemotherapy, Neoplasm progression, Peripheral T-cell lymphoma unspecified, Vitritis, Metastases to lung, Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Malignant transformation, Vitreous haze, Lymphoma transformation, Drug interaction, Mucosal inflammation, Iatrogenic metastasis, Lymphoma, Leukaemic infiltration, Angiocentric lymphoma stage III, Prophylactic chemotherapy, Metastases to lymph nodes, Metastases to liver, Vitreous disorder, Angiocentric lymphoma stage II, Angiocentric lymphoma stage IV, Malignant histiocytosis, Anaplastic large cell lymphoma T- and null-cell types, Chemotherapy extravasation management, Metastases to central nervous system, Bone marrow tumour cell infiltration, Gamma radiation therapy, Retinal infiltrates, Radiotherapy to head and neck, Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma stage III, Bone marrow leukaemic cell infiltration, Hepatic lymphocytic infiltration, Radiotherapy, Adenocarcinoma metastatic, Lung infiltration\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

The article discusses a case of primary orbital natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma with cerebrospinal fluid involvement. It mentions that the patient was treated with orbital radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy, and that the lymphoma relapsed in the contralateral eye, suggesting metastasis. The article also mentions that the patient was initially suspected of having acute uveitis. The adverse reactions related to the disease and treatment can be inferred from the context of the article, such as the progression of the lymphoma and the treatment modalities used.\\\\n\\\\nReactions:\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653454.5331073}
