ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Paraneoplastic neurologic diseases (PND) are rare but can occur in patients with common malignancies including breast cancer. In patients with hormone receptor (HR)-negative human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, PND have been reported in association with anti-Yo antibodies and with clinical presentation of paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. We describe the case of a woman with progressively altered mental status and seizures, ultimately requiring admission. Based on her clinical presentation, imaging findings, and evidence of neural-directed antibodies in her serum and cerebrospinal fluid, she was diagnosed with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (LE) due to an underlying HR-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer. She showed a transient response to immunosuppression but had more significant improvement after surgical resection and initiation of chemotherapy along with HER2-directed therapy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of paraneoplastic LE in a patient with HR-negative, HER2-positive breast cancer likely caused by the production of an unclassified anti-neuronal antibody. TEXT: INTRODUCTION Paraneoplastic neurologic diseases (PND) including limbic encephalitis (LE) have been reported to occur in association with breast cancer for many decades, although its incidence is quite rare [1]. Breast cancer-related neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes can have diverse presentations, including sensory and motor-type neuropathies, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, stiff person syndrome, encephalomyelitis, and paraneoplastic retinopathy [1]. Because breast cancer-related paraneoplastic syndromes are uncommon, only limited data are available to support their association with specific breast cancer subsets, presence of certain histological subtypes, advanced clinical stage, or lymphovascular invasion [1]. The diagnosis of a paraneoplastic neurological disorder requires the presence of neurological symptoms, diagnosis of cancer within 4 years, exclusion of other neurological disorders, and at least one of the following findings: cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showing inflammation with negative cytology, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating characteristic hyperintensity signals on T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery images of the medial temporal lobe(s), or epileptic activity in the temporal lobes by electroencephalogram (EEG) [12]. The presence of autoantibodies in the blood or CSF is not necessary for diagnosis. Interestingly, neuron-specific autoantibodies are only found in approximately 60%\\\\u201370% of patients with clinically diagnosed paraneoplastic syndromes associated with breast cancer [1]. Therefore, antibody testing may be helpful if positive, but the absence of antibodies cannot rule out paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome [1].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Immunosuppression, Breast cancer, Chemotherapy, HER2 positive breast cancer, Breast cancer female, Limbic encephalitis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Breast cancer male, Hormone receptor positive breast cancer, Invasive breast carcinoma, HER2 negative breast cancer, Drug ineffective, Malignant nipple neoplasm, Breast cancer metastatic, Malignant nipple neoplasm female, Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis, Chemotherapy single agent systemic, Prophylactic chemotherapy, Invasive ductal breast carcinoma, Immunomodulatory therapy, Chemotherapy multiple agents systemic, Regional chemotherapy, Breast sarcoma, Breast cancer stage II, Inflammatory carcinoma of the breast, Neuroendocrine breast tumour, Triple positive breast cancer, Metaplastic breast carcinoma, Malignant nipple neoplasm male, Anti-neuronal antibody, Metastases to breast, Chemotherapy side effect prophylaxis, Immunochemotherapy, Medullary carcinoma of breast, Lesion excision, Breast cancer in situ, Chemotherapy cytokine prophylaxis, Chemotherapy toxicity attenuation, Apocrine breast carcinoma, Squamous cell breast carcinoma, Chemotherapy extravasation management, Tubular breast carcinoma, Subcision, Neutralising antibodies, Breast cancer stage I, Triple negative breast cancer, Immune disorder prophylaxis, Non-neutralising antibodies, Breast cancer stage IV, Breast cancer recurrent\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653892.482253}
