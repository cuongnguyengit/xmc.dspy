ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Fluorescence in situ hybridization-based confirmation of acute graft-vs-host disease diagnosis following liver transplantation: A case report. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Although acute graft-vs-host disease (aGvHD) is a rare complication of liver transplantation, it is poorly understood and has an extremely high mortality rate. No standardized diagnostic criteria or treatment regimens currently exist. METHODS The present study investigated the etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of aGvHD following liver transplantation. Presentation, diagnosis, disease course, histology, and treatment of an aGvHD case are reported, and associated literature is reviewed. A 64-year-old female required LTx due to primary biliary cirrhosis. The donor was a 12-year-old male. Three weeks following liver transplantation, the recipient developed pyrexia, diarrhea, rashes, and antibiotic-unresponsive pancytopenia. Clinical symptoms together with laboratory investigations suggested a diagnosis of aGvHD, which was confirmed via peripheral blood fluorescent in situ hybridization. Donor XY chromosome fluorescent in situ hybridization indicating early chimerism achieved 93% sensitivity in the detection of GvHD. Existing immunosuppressants were discontinued, and high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated along with antibiotics. While diarrhea resolved, the patient\\'s general condition continued to deteriorate until demise due to multi-system organ failure at 37 d post-liver transplantation. This case illustrates the life-threatening nature of aGvHD. CONCLUSIONS Herein, we have summarized a post-LTx aGvHD case and reviewed associated literature in order to increase awareness and provide potentially risk-mitigating recommendations. TEXT: pmcCore Tip: At present, the risk factors, pathogenesis, optimal treatment, and prognosis associated with acute graft-vs-host disease following liver transplantation are unclear. Currently, the most reliable diagnostic method is specific immunostaining for donor-specific antigens. If the donor is male and the recipient is female, fluorescent in situ hybridization-based detection of the Y chromosome is a diagnostic option. In the present case, acute graft-vs-host disease was confirmed via fluorescent in situ hybridization, demonstrating the presence of male donor DNA.
