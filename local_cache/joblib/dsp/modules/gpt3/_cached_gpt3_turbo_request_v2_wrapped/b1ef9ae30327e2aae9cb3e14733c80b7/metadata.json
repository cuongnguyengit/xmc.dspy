ABSTRACT: Caudal epidural injection is a common intervention in patients with low back pain and sciatica. Even though the complications of fluoroscopically directed epidural injections are less frequent than in blind epidural injections, complications due to contrast media can occur. We report a case of anaphylactic shock immediately after injection of an intravenous nonionic contrast medium (iohexol) during the caudal epidural injection for low back pain and sciatica in a patient without a previous allergic history to ionic contrast media (ioxitalamate). Five minutes after the dye was injected, the patient began to experience dizziness, and the systolic blood pressure dropped to 60 mmHg. Subsequently, the patient exhibited a mild drowsy mental state. About 30 minutes after the subcutaneous injection of 0.2 mg epinephrine, the systolic blood pressure increased to 90 mmHg. The patient recovered without any sequela. Life-threatening complications after injection of intravenous contrast medium require immediate treatment. TEXT: The prevalence of chronic spinal pain is gradually increasing in Korea [1]. Epidural injections are commonly used interventions for managing spinal pain. One of these interventions is a caudal block that is commonly performed by physicians and is considered a safe and easy approach, with minimal risk of inadvertent dural puncture [23]. Caudal epidural injections have been reported to be associated with a few complications. Even though the complications of fluoroscopically guided caudal epidural injections are less frequent than in blind epidural injections, caudal epidural injections guided by fluoroscopy are not devoid of complications. The use of contrast media has a risk of adverse effects, from mild rash to fatal anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reaction that can lead to death [45]. Anaphylactic shock due to contrast medium is a serious but rare complication. We report a case of severe anaphylactic shock caused by a nonionic contrast medium (iohexol) following caudal epidural injection for low back pain and sciatica in a patient without a previous allergic history to ionic contrast media (ioxitalamate). CASE REPORT A 78-year-old woman visited the pain clinic for management of low back pain and sciatica. The patient did not have any underlying disease except for hypertension. The patient recently underwent a caudal epidural block and a transforaminal epidural block 6 times in a year by using an ionic contrast medium (ioxitalamate, Telebrix\\\\u00ae). She underwent a caudal epidural block 4 times, and had no history of allergic reactions to contrast media or other substances. All procedures were performed without complications.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Dizziness, Anaphylactic reaction, Anaphylactic shock, Blood pressure increased, Acute kidney injury, Shock, Septic shock, Epinephrine, Blood pressure systolic, Anaphylactoid reaction, Vertigo, Anaphylactoid shock, Hypotension, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Labile hypertension, Malignant hypertension, Dizziness postural, Nausea, Hypertensive urgency, Essential hypertension, Confusional state, Disorientation, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Blood pressure diastolic, Hypertensive angiopathy, Vertigo labyrinthine, Anaphylactic transfusion reaction, Orthostatic hypertension, Tachycardia, Respiratory failure, Circulatory collapse, Systolic hypertension, Vertigo positional, Norepinephrine, Blood pressure systolic abnormal, Blood pressure orthostatic increased, Renal hypertension, Prehypertension, Pyrexia, Neurogenic hypertension, Secondary hypertension, Cardiogenic shock, Vertigo CNS origin, Mean arterial pressure, Right ventricular systolic pressure, Hypertensive emergency\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653631.969782}
