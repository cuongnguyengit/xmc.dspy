ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Multimodality imaging of a rare pulmonary artery sessile mass: a case report. ABSTRACT: Primary pulmonary artery masses are unusual entities that mimic pulmonary embolism (PE) in clinical presentation and on imaging studies. It is necessary to perform advanced diagnostic exams, such as transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to determine the proper diagnosis. In unclear cases, laboratory findings, morphological follow-up, and response to anticoagulant therapy can help to clarify the diagnosis. A 47-year-old previously healthy man with worsening effort dyspnoea underwent chest computed tomography (CT) for suspicion of PE, which showed a pedunculated eccentric mass at the origin of the pulmonary artery causing severe stenosis. The patient was started on anticoagulation therapy, but, after TEE and cardiac MRI, a neoplastic fibroelastic mass was suspected. Unexpectedly, 18fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)-CT revealed a unique area of glucose uptake in the superior lobe of the left lung and not in the pulmonary artery. The biopsy was consistent with pleomorphic high-grade lung sarcoma. After 3 months of chemotherapy, a CT scan showed progression of the lung disease with no change in the arterial mass, which was therefore confirmed as pulmonary fibroelastoma. Due to the rarity of pulmonary artery tumours, they can be initially misdiagnosed as PE or a metastasis of a lung sarcoma. Three-dimensional TEE and cardiac MRI are particularly useful in differentiating tumours from PE. TEXT: Learning points The diagnosis of neoplastic masses should be considered in patients with suspicion of pulmonary embolism, especially those with poor response to anticoagulant therapy.1,2 Thrombus and mass are difficult to differentiate. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging are helpful for the complete morphological and functional evaluation of cardiac masses.3 Introduction Primary cardiac masses are rare entities that can be easily mistaken for thromboembolic events, with serious prognostic implications. We report a case in which a pulmonary artery mass and its clinical presentation played a pivotal role in diagnosing a high-grade pulmonary sarcoma that was clinically silent. Timeline Day 0 The patient presented with sudden dyspnoea. Computed tomography (CT): pulmonary artery obstruction, probably due to embolism. An oral anticoagulant therapy was started. Electrocardiogram (ECG): right axial deviation. High T waves. Week 2 Transesophageal echocardiography: 17 \\\\u00d7 13 mm sessile mass at the right ventricle outflow tract. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): 13 \\\\u00d7 53 mm fibrous vegetation, extended to pulmonary bifurcation. Week 3 18FDG PET-CT: area of glucose uptake at the superior lobe of the left lung, no uptake in the heart. Month 2 New admission for: control CT and US-guided biopsy of the pulmonary mass that revealed a pleomorphic high-grade sarcoma.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Anticoagulant therapy, Drug ineffective, Procoagulant therapy, Magnetic resonance imaging heart, Heparin neutralisation therapy, Thrombosis prophylaxis, Anticoagulation drug level therapeutic, Magnetic resonance imaging thoracic, Cardiac imaging procedure, Anticoagulation drug level, Magnetic resonance imaging, Anticoagulation drug level above therapeutic, Echocardiogram, Anticoagulation drug level below therapeutic, Haemorrhage prophylaxis, Circulating anticoagulant, Anticoagulation drug level increased, Antiplatelet therapy, Hypercoagulation, Disseminated intravascular coagulation, Anticoagulation drug level decreased, Positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging, Anticoagulation drug level abnormal, Thrombolysis, Anticoagulation drug level normal, Haemostasis, Stress echocardiogram, Antithrombin III, Scan gallium, Blood disorder prophylaxis, Circulating anticoagulant positive, Vascular disorder prophylaxis, Thrombocytopenia, Anti-thrombin antibody, Coagulation factor inhibitor assay, Factor II inhibition, Argon plasma coagulation, Plasmin inhibitor, Platelet aggregation inhibition, Antiangiogenic therapy, Factor IX inhibition, Positron emission tomogram, Atherosclerosis prophylaxis, Thrombosis, Multiple gated acquisition scan, Drug interaction, Blood thromboplastin, Fibrin degradation products, Blood thrombin, Anti factor X activity\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653951.235769}
