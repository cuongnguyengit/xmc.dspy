ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \\\\\"found down\\\\\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \\\\u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \\\\u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\\\\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\\\\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \\\\u201ccatch up\\\\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Insomnia, Compartment syndrome, Crush syndrome, Somnolence, Acute kidney injury, Fatigue, Sleep disorder, Sleep deficit, Poor quality sleep, Sleep inertia, Sleep terror, Irregular sleep phase, Behavioural induced insufficient sleep syndrome, Middle insomnia, Parasomnia, Dyssomnia, Terminal insomnia, Abnormal sleep-related event, Abdominal compartment syndrome, Delayed sleep phase, Psychophysiologic insomnia, Paradoxical insomnia, Advanced sleep phase, Somnambulism, Crush injury, Sleep attacks, Sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, Hyposomnia, Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, Orbital compartment syndrome, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition insomnia type, Condition aggravated, Initial insomnia, Irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition parasomnia type, Hypersomnia, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition mixed type, Myalgia, Bedridden, Behavioural insomnia of childhood, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition hypersomnia type, Decompression sickness, Breathing-related sleep disorder, Loss of dreaming, Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Rapid eye movements sleep abnormal, Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Lethargy, Crushing injury of trunk, Sudden onset of sleep\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: Anthracyclines constitute the backbone of intensive adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy. Cardiotoxicity is one of its most serious adverse effects, and its incidence increases with cumulative dose. Dexrazoxane is a cardioprotective agent used in conjunction with anthracycline therapy. There is limited data of its usage in adult AML patients. We report the outcomes of six older adults at high risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity who received dexrazoxane during induction/re-induction therapy. Five had preserved left-ventricular function while two proceeded onto stem-cell transplantation. Additional investigation of dexrazoxane in adult leukemia therapy is warranted, particularly in older patients at highest risk for cardiovascular mortality. TEXT: 1 Introduction Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for 80% of acute leukemia in adults with a median age at diagnosis of 65 years [1]. The standard upfront induction regimen for fit adult individuals remains \\\\u201c7+3\\\\u201d, consisting of 7 days of continuous infusion cytarabine and 3 days of an anthracycline, either daunorubicin or idarubicin [2]. Variations of induction and re-induction regimens in the refractory/relapsed disease setting often include either idarubicin or mitoxantrone in conjunction with high dose cytarabine and sometimes purine analogues. Medical comorbidities, specifically cardiovascular morbidity, have been shown to negatively impact the clinical outcomes of AML induction therapy in older adults. Cardiotoxicity constitutes the most frequently feared adverse event associated with the use of anthracyclines (>10%), and compromised cardiac function may compromise the use of potentially curative upfront and subsequent AML regimens in a patient\\'s course. Prevention or mitigation of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, particularly in older adults who constitute the majority of new AML diagnoses, is therefore an area of tremendous clinical relevance. Cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines is dose-dependent and can occur at any time in the treatment course with acute, subacute, and late-onset presentations. Clinical symptoms include arrhythmias, myopericarditis, cardiomyopathy, and congestive heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) [3], [4], [5]. For example, the incidence of cardiotoxic events with use of doxorubicin was less than 5% at a cumulative dose of 400 mg/m2, but increased in a dose-dependent manner to 16% at a cumulative dose of 500 mg/m2, 26% at 550 mg/m2, and 48% at 700 mg/m2\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Cardiotoxicity, Toxic cardiomyopathy, Cytarabine syndrome, Toxicity to various agents, Chemotherapy cardiotoxicity attenuation, Drug resistance, Drug interaction, Heart injury, Cardiac ablation, Death, Drug ineffective, Stress cardiomyopathy, Cardiogenic shock, Carcinoid heart disease, Overdose, Neurotoxicity, Cardioactive drug level therapeutic, Cardiac disorder, Hepatotoxicity, Cardioactive drug level, Cardioactive drug level above therapeutic, Tachycardia induced cardiomyopathy, Chemotherapy, Athletic heart syndrome, Cardioactive drug level increased, Cardiomyopathy alcoholic, External counterpulsation, Drug-induced liver injury, Cardiomyopathy, Tachycardia, Cardiac procedure complication, Arrhythmia prophylaxis, Endocarditis prophylaxis, Myocardial reperfusion injury, Positive cardiac inotropic effect, Cardiac contusion, Cardiac infection, Radiation myocarditis, Thyrotoxic cardiomyopathy, Anaesthetic complication cardiac, Cardiac myxoma, Cardioactive drug level below therapeutic, Negative cardiac inotropic effect, Poisoning, Cardiac operation, Cardioversion, Chemotherapy multiple agents systemic, Systemic toxicity, Cardiac iron overload, Meningococcal carditis\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
