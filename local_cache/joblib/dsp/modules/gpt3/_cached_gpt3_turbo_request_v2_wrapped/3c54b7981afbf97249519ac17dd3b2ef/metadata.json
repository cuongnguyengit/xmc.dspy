ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND The improvement of survival outcomes and the reduction of toxicities for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) are still needed. We conducted a pilot study of concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin for the treatment of esophageal SCC with T4 and/or M1 lymph node metastasis (LNM) or locoregional recurrence. METHODS Fifty-four patients with advanced thoracic esophageal SCC having a stage T4 tumor or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence were enrolled. Docetaxel and cisplatin were both administered weekly at a dose of 25 mg/m2 5-6 times in total concurrently with a specific dose of radiation. The primary endpoint was overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control and treatment-related toxicities. RESULTS From October 2015 to December 2016, concurrent treatment with full-cycle docetaxel and cisplatin and radiotherapy was administered to 41 of 54 patients (75.9%). A total of 51 patients (94.4%) completed the radiation schedules. Twenty-one patients (44.4%) achieved a complete response, and 21 (44.4%) achieved a partial response after chemoradiotherapy. The median survival time was 18.2 months, and the median PFS time was 11.5 months. The 1-year and 3-year OS, locoregional control and PFS rates were 70.4, 80.6, 50.0 and 36.4%, 64.3, 31.5%, respectively. Grade 3 toxicities included neutropenia (13.0%), anemia (3.7%), thrombocytopenia (1.9%), fatigue (20.4%), anorexia (13.0%), esophagitis (11.1%), and pneumonitis (5.6%). Grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 16.7% of patients. Four patients (7.4%) died from grade 5 toxicities. There were no significant differences in both survival and grade 3 and higher toxicities between the newly diagnosed group and recurrent group. CONCLUSIONS Concurrent chemoradiotherapy with weekly docetaxel and cisplatin is a well-tolerated and effective treatment regimen for esophageal SCC with T4 or M1 LNM and/or locoregional recurrence. Clinical trials with larger sample size and comparisons with conventional fluorouracil and cisplatin regimens are needed.

ABSTRACT: Patients with imaging findings concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage, however, with no evidence of hemorrhage following autopsy or cerebrospinal fluid testing are diagnosed with having pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage. A 73-year-old female presented to the emergency department with altered mental status one day after undergoing a lumbar epidural steroid injection at an outside hospital; a noncontrast computed tomography scan of the head revealed evidence of diffuse hyperdensity within the subarachnoid space concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage. The patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging which demonstrated diffuse opacification of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces with gadolinium and the diagnoses of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage and gadolinium encephalopathy were made. The combination of the neurologic symptoms related to gadolinium encephalopathy and the radiographic findings of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage can create a clinical presentation nearly identical to ruptured aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Patient history, magnetic resonance imaging findings, and temporal changes in computed tomography provide vital tools in establishing a diagnosis of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage, especially after an iatrogenic intrathecal contrast administration. TEXT: Introduction Despite the 90% sensitivity and nearly 100% specificity of computed tomography of the head (CTH) in the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), false positives do occur [3,8,11]. Patients with imaging findings concerning for subarachnoid hemorrhage, however, with no evidence of hemorrhage following autopsy or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing are diagnosed with having pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage (pSAH) [2,15]. Several etiologies of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage have been described including spontaneous intracranial hypotension, cerebral edema related to hypoxic-ischemic injury, cerebral/cerebellar infarction, subdural hemorrhage, meningeal infection, and hyperhemoglobinemia. Iatrogenic causes are less common, however, include patients following intrathecal, intravenous, or intra-arterial contrast administration [4,7,9,12,16]. This study includes a case description of a patient who presented with pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage and gadolinium encephalopathy following a lumbar epidural steroid injection and review of iatrogenic causes of pseudo-subarachnoid hemorrhage following intrathecal administration of contrast.
