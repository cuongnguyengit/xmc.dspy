ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of various Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors (TKIs) plus bevacizumab in advanced EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients. From August 2016 to October 2020, we enrolled advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients harboring exon 19 deletion or L858R receiving gefitinib, erlotinib and afatinib plus bevacizumab as the first-line treatment for the purposes of analysis. A total of 36 patients were included in the final analysis. Three patients received gefitinib, 17 received erlotinib, and 16 received afatinib combined with bevacizumab as the first-line treatment. The objective response rate was 77.8%, and disease control rate was 94.4%. The overall median progression-free survival (PFS) was 16.4 months, while the median PFS was 17.1 months in patients with exon 19 deletion, and 16.2 months in patients with L858R mutation (p=0.311). Regarding the use of different EGFR-TKIs, the median PFS was 17.1 months in the erlotinib group and 21.6 months in the afatinib group (p=0.617). In patients with brain metastasis at baseline, the median PFS was 18.9 months in the erlotinib group and 16.4 months in the afatinib group (p=0.747). Amongst patients harboring exon 19 deletion, the median PFS was 16.2 months in the erlotinib group and not-reached in the afatinib group (p=0.141). In patients with L858R mutation, the median PFS was 18.9 months in the erlotinib group and 16.2 months in the afatinib group (p=0.481). Our research demonstrates that not only erlotinib combined with bevacizumab, but also afatinib plus bevacizumab as first-line treatment, provides solid clinical efficacy in advanced EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients. TEXT: pmcIntroduction Lung cancer is the leading cause of mortality worldwide. Amongst patients with lung cancer, 80%\\\\u201385% were classified as non\\\\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Currently, the treatment for NSCLC is individualized and based on the results of histology and molecular biology tests. Patients with an oncogenic druggable mutation and genotype-directed therapy experience longer overall survival (OS) [1]. In Asia, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation is the most common driver mutation gene, and accounts for approximately 50%\\\\u201360% of patients with lung adenocarcinoma [2,3]. Previous clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC patients undergoing first- and second-generation EGFR\\\\u2013tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment experienced better progression-free survival (PFS) and fewer adverse effects than patients who underwent platinum-based chemotherapy [4,5].\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Metastases to central nervous system, Brain cancer metastatic, Metastases to meninges, Metastases to nervous system, Brain neoplasm malignant, Metastatic nervous system neoplasm, Metastatic glioma, Metastases to pituitary gland, Chromosomal deletion, 18q minus syndrome, Malignant neoplasm progression, Metastases to lung, Brain neoplasm, Head and neck cancer metastatic, Gliomatosis cerebri, Pituitary cancer metastatic, Anti-VGKC antibody, EGFR gene mutation, Metastases to spinal cord, Second primary malignancy, Metastasis, Metastases to eye, Trisomy 21, Malignant meningioma metastatic, Malignant nervous system neoplasm, LDLR mutation, RPE65 gene mutation, Metastases to bone, Metastatic neoplasm, EGFR status assay, Metastases to adrenals, Metastases to the respiratory system, Intracranial meningioma malignant, Trisomy 18, Brain sarcoma, Trisomy 9, Mitochondrial DNA deletion, Brain teratoma, Medulloblastoma, Ocular cancer metastatic, Malignant glioma, Trisomy 17, Brain stem glioma, 1p36 deletion syndrome, Glioma, Metastases to peripheral nervous system, Central nervous system leukaemia, Neuroendocrine carcinoma metastatic, UGT1A1 gene mutation, Primitive neuroectodermal tumour metastatic\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

The article discusses the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs plus bevacizumab in advanced EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients. It does not mention specific adverse reactions to the treatment but does discuss the presence of brain metastasis in some patients and the progression-free survival (PFS) associated with different mutations and treatments. The article mentions exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation as genetic factors related to the disease, not as adverse reactions.
