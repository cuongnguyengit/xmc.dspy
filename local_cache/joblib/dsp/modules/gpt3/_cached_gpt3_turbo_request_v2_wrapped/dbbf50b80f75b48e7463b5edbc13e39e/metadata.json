ABSTRACT: Despite extensive review in the literature, compartment syndrome and crush syndrome remain difficult to diagnose. Trauma, toxins and reperfusion have been associated with these syndromes. Cases involving alcohol and drug abuse have described patients \\\\\"found down\\\\\" compressing an extremity. We present a case of a registered nurse who developed compartment syndrome in multiple limbs due to prolonged sleep after sleep deprivation and zolpidem use. To our knowledge, this is the first case of compartment syndrome or crush syndrome to have occurred in the setting of zolpidem use. Sleep disruption in healthcare workers represents a public health issue with dangerous sequelae, both acute and chronic. TEXT: INTRODUCTION A shift worker is defined as \\\\u201canyone who works extended-duration shifts and other variable and nonstandard hours \\\\u2026 late into the night or very early in the morning.\\\\u201d1 Nurses and hospital staff implemented shift-based scheduling long ago. Emergency physicians (EP) adopted the practice early in the evolution of the specialty. Hospitals are non-stop businesses with high rates of error occurring at very high stakes. Hospital staff and physicians who work night shifts and swing shifts are subjected to circadian disruption that leads to fatigue, poor performance, and patient harm. Many shift workers find themselves unable to obtain satisfactory quality or quantity of sleep due to rotating schedules. Sleep deprivation has been shown to impair vigilance, cognition, memory and fine motor skills.2 Night shift work and subsequent circadian disturbance have independent deleterious effects on these parameters.2 Cognitive performance decline from sleep deprivation appears similar to alcohol intoxication, with 17 hours of wakefulness correlating to a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% and 24 hours to 0.10%.3 Compartment syndrome refers to the pressure increase in a closed fascial space to the point of reduced capillary perfusion.4 Usually due to long bone fracture, these pressure increases can ensue when a limb is crushed by a person\\\\u2019s own bodyweight. With severe or prolonged crushing force, muscle necrosis occurs with subsequent life-threatening systemic effects: rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, hyperkalemia, and death. We present the case of a registered nurse who used pharmaceuticals to \\\\u201ccatch up\\\\u201d on sleep, waking up 30 hours later with crush and compartment syndromes in multiple limbs. CASE REPORT An African-American female in her early thirties with normal body mass index and no past medical history sought rest after 30 hours without sleep. The patient took 50 milligrams (mg) of diphenhydramine and five mg of immediate-release zolpidem. She awoke unable to move her right upper and lower extremities and had severe pain in the right side of her body. The patient contacted staff in her emergency department (ED) and was encouraged to call emergency medical services for transport to the hospital.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Insomnia, Compartment syndrome, Crush syndrome, Somnolence, Acute kidney injury, Fatigue, Sleep disorder, Sleep deficit, Poor quality sleep, Sleep inertia, Sleep terror, Irregular sleep phase, Behavioural induced insufficient sleep syndrome, Middle insomnia, Parasomnia, Dyssomnia, Terminal insomnia, Abnormal sleep-related event, Abdominal compartment syndrome, Delayed sleep phase, Psychophysiologic insomnia, Paradoxical insomnia, Advanced sleep phase, Somnambulism, Crush injury, Sleep attacks, Sleep disorder due to a general medical condition, Hyposomnia, Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, Orbital compartment syndrome, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition insomnia type, Condition aggravated, Initial insomnia, Irregular sleep wake rhythm disorder, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition parasomnia type, Hypersomnia, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition mixed type, Myalgia, Bedridden, Behavioural insomnia of childhood, Sleep disorder due to general medical condition hypersomnia type, Decompression sickness, Breathing-related sleep disorder, Loss of dreaming, Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, Rapid eye movements sleep abnormal, Circadian rhythm sleep disorder, Lethargy, Crushing injury of trunk, Sudden onset of sleep\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.

ABSTRACT: 5-Fluorouracil remains a foundational component of chemotherapy for solid tumour malignancies. While considered a generally safe and effective chemotherapeutic, 5-fluorouracil has demonstrated severe adverse event rates of up to 30%. Understanding the pharmacokinetics of 5-fluorouracil can improve the precision medicine approaches to this therapy. A single enzyme, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), mediates 80% of 5-fluorouracil elimination, through hepatic metabolism. Importantly, it has been known for over 30-years that adverse events during 5-fluorouracil therapy are linked to high systemic exposure, and to those patients who exhibit DPD deficiency. To date, pre-treatment screening for DPD deficiency in patients with planned 5-fluorouracil-based therapy is not a standard of care. Here we provide a focused review of 5-fluorouracil metabolism, and the efforts to improve predictive dosing through screening for DPD deficiency. We also outline the history of key discoveries relating to DPD deficiency and include relevant information on the potential benefit of therapeutic drug monitoring of 5-fluorouracil. Finally, we present a brief case report that highlights a limitation of pharmacogenetics, where we carried out therapeutic drug monitoring of 5-fluorouracil in an orthotopic liver transplant recipient. This case supports the development of robust multimodality precision medicine services, capable of accommodating complex clinical dilemmas. TEXT: 1. Introduction to Fluoropyrimidines 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) has remained an important antineoplastic agent since the first description of the fluoropyrimidine class in 1957, and approval for testing in humans in 1962 [1,2]. Fluoropyrimidines, including 5-fluorouracil and its oral pre-prodrug capecitabine, serve as core components in the treatment of colorectal, pancreatic, gastric, breast, head and neck cancers [2,3,4]. However, the use of fluoropyrimidines carries an unfortunate risk of severe adverse events (AEs) of up to 30% [5,6]. Common AEs observed with fluoropyrimidine chemotherapies include non-bloody diarrhea, mucosal ulceration, immune suppression, and a painful skin condition known as hand-foot syndrome. Through optimizing the delivery methods, dosing schedules, and concomitant antineoplastic agents, a number of modern combination regimens with a fluoropyrimidine backbone have emerged including FOLFOX, FOLFIRINOX, CAPOX, and FLOT. Nevertheless, clinical trials using fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapies continue to show severe AE rates up to 23% [7,8,9,10]. Accordingly, delineating the genetic and non-genetic determinants of fluoropyrimidine metabolism and efficacy, is essential to the implementation of precision medicine approaches for fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Condition aggravated, Adverse event, Drug ineffective, Chemotherapy, Adverse reaction, Treatment failure, Chemotherapy single agent systemic, Drug interaction, Prophylactic chemotherapy, No adverse event, Chemotherapy multiple agents systemic, Regional chemotherapy, Death, Adverse drug reaction, Chemotherapy side effect prophylaxis, Overdose, Chemotherapy toxicity attenuation, Chemotherapy extravasation management, Immunosuppression, Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, Drug therapy, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Adverse event following immunisation, Neoplasm prophylaxis, Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, Therapeutic response decreased, Disease progression, Neoadjuvant therapy, Immunochemotherapy, Targeted cancer therapy, Porphyria, Chemotherapy neurotoxicity attenuation, Hyperthermic chemotherapy, Cancer hormonal therapy, Drug resistance, Chemotherapy cytokine prophylaxis, Porphyrin metabolism disorder, Drug intolerance, Biotherapy, Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase deficiency, Chemotherapy urothelial toxicity attenuation, Chelation therapy, Off label use, Purine metabolism disorder, Multiple drug therapy, Chemotherapy cardiotoxicity attenuation, Reactogenicity event, Pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, Ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 deficiency, Leukaemia recurrent prophylaxis\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the output.
