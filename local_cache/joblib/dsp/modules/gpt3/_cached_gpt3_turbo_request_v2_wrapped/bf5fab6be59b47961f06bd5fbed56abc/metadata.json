The vacancy mentions a degree in \\\\\"Production Mechanical Electrical Marine Engineering (or similar)\\\\\" and the candidate might be \\\\\"newly educated.\\\\\" This suggests that the job requires a foundational understanding of engineering principles, particularly in the fields mentioned. Since the candidate might be newly educated, we can infer that the job may not require extensive experience but rather a solid educational background in the relevant engineering disciplines. We should look for skills that are related to mechanical, electrical, and marine engineering, as well as general engineering competencies that a recent graduate might possess.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: marine engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, operate mechanical equipment of ships, manage ship electrical systems, operate ship equipment, maintain shipboard machinery, maritime transportation technology, offshore constructions and facilities, provide support in vessel machinery systems\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: SQL experience is a plus but not required\\\\n\\\\nOptions: SQL, SQL Server, database, MySQL, use databases, PostgreSQL, Oracle Relational Database, data warehouse, database management systems, use query languages, query languages, manage database, Microsoft Access, operate relational database management system, database development tools, maintain database, data analytics, Teradata Database, CA Datacom/DB, business intelligence, Solidity, SPARQL, search databases, database quality standards, perform data mining, perform records management, data models, data mining, Drupal, maintain database performance, create data models, NoSQL, create database diagrams, manage quantitative data, implement data warehousing techniques, develop data processing applications, PHP, accounting, C#, design database scheme, SAP Data Services, DB2, use logic programming, manage data, data storage, balance database resources, SAS Data Management, perform data analysis, use accounting systems, use data processing techniques\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to identify the skills that are directly expressed or implied as beneficial for the job vacancy. The vacancy mentions \\\\\"SQL experience is a plus but not required,\\\\\" which suggests that while SQL skills are advantageous, they are not a mandatory requirement for the job. Therefore, we should focus on skills related to SQL and databases, as these are the most relevant to the statement provided.\\\\n\\\\nSkills: Skills: SQL, use databases, use query languages, query languages, manage database, database management systems, operate relational database management system, maintain database, create data models, manage data\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nVacancy: The tasks can be feeding moving castration insemination monitoring the animals health and others .\\\\n\\\\nOptions: monitor the welfare of animals, monitor condition of hospitalised animals, assess animal\\'s condition, check the health of livestock, assess management of animals, monitor livestock, monitor the identification of animals, inspect animal welfare management, perform veterinary diagnosis, conduct ante-mortem veterinary health inspection, examine animals, support veterinary diagnostic procedures, carry out feeding operations, check animal feeding behaviour, assess animal behaviour, oversee animal management, administer treatment to animals, manage animal biosecurity, investigate animal related incidents, advise on animal welfare, assess environment of animals, handle veterinary emergencies, provide first aid to animals, signs of animal illness, manage animal welfare, manage the health and welfare of livestock, biosecurity related to animals, produce reports based on animal records, migration, livestock feeding, instruct animal owners, regulate animal health standards, monitor wildlife, interview animal owners on animals\\' conditions, assess the animal\\\\u2019s rehabilitation requirements, veterinary clinical sciences, protect health and safety when handling animals, first aid for animals, instruct on animal care, apply veterinary epidemiology, monitor fish health status, comply with veterinary inspection standards, coordinate care of neglected animals, make decisions regarding the animal\\'s welfare, control animals in distress, provide nursing care for hospitalised animals, perform gross post mortem examination on animals, assess animal nutrition, advise on long-term care for animals, liaise with animal welfare agencies\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706652494.4738128}
