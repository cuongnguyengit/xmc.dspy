ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection.

ABSTRACT: Routine 25-OH-Vitamin D3 measurement in COVID-19 patients could be of great importance, either for clinical course estimation or deciding on supplementation. TEXT: 1 INTRODUCTION We report mild COVID\\\\u201019 manifestation in a high\\\\u2010risk patient with sufficient plasma 25\\\\u2010OH\\\\u2010Vitamin D3 level. Given the global pandemic of vitamin D deficiency, as well as its likely beneficial effects during SARS\\\\u2010CoV\\\\u20102 infection, our report highlights importance of routine 25\\\\u2010OH\\\\u2010Vitamin D3 measurement, either for clinical course prediction or deciding on supplementation. During the recent COVID\\\\u201019 pandemic, several well\\\\u2010defined conditions have been recognized as risk factors worsening disease course and outcome. 1 , 2 The most important risk factors which can lead to severe COVID\\\\u201019 symptomatology are obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, age over 65 years, and immunosuppressive therapy. 3 , 4 These conditions are thought to affect host responses to infection by various mechanisms, enhancing, and accelerating the harmful pathophysiological processes. 5 Crucial events during COVID\\\\u201019 pathogenesis are initial viral immune evasion and subsequent hyperinflammatory response resulting from excessive and undirected immune activation. 6 Patients with risk factors more likely react with extremely excessive systemic inflammation resulting with cytokine storm which is considered as an executive pathophysiological mechanism responsible for severe disease manifestations, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), diffuse endothelial damage with accelerated thrombogenesis, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). 6 In most groups of risk patients, common mechanism favoring development of excessive inflammation and cytokine storm is persistently present proinflammatory milieu. 7 Such chronic proinflammatory state can arise either due to hypersecretion of proinflammatory adipokines in obese patients, 7 lack of anti\\\\u2010inflammatory signaling in diabetic, and insulin\\\\u2010resistant patients 7 , 8 or dysregulation of renin\\\\u2010angiotensin system (RAS) with increased proinflammatory angiotensin II (Ang II) production in hypertensive patients. 6 , 9 , 10 Patients on immunosuppressive therapy are considered to be at risk due to the facilitated viral multiplication and dissemination during the initial phase, enabling in turn more vigorous ignition of hyperinflammatory phase. 6 , 10 , 11 In the other hand, hyperactive inflammatory processes could be kept under control to some extent by immunosuppressants, but conclusions and recommendations on their use in COVID\\\\u201019 patients are inconsistent and unclear. 12 Moreover, most intriguing obscurity during COVID\\\\u201019 pandemic\\\\u2014enormous variability of clinical presentation and unpredictability of outcome, either in previously healthy or in at\\\\u2010risk patients, still remains enigmatic.\\\\n\\\\nOptions: Hypertension, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Diabetes mellitus, Acute respiratory distress syndrome, Acute kidney injury, Blood pressure increased, Immunosuppression, Respiratory failure, Obesity, Weight increased, Vitamin D deficiency, Cytokine storm, Weight decreased, Decreased appetite, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Respiratory distress, Sepsis, Hypotension, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Septic shock, Acute respiratory failure, Central obesity, Overweight, White coat hypertension, Accelerated hypertension, Type 2 diabetes mellitus, Labile hypertension, Renal failure, Malignant hypertension, Renal impairment, Cytokine release syndrome, Vitamin D decreased, Hypertensive urgency, Essential hypertension, Condition aggravated, Type 3 diabetes mellitus, COVID-19, Hyperglycaemia, Blood pressure ambulatory increased, Mean arterial pressure increased, Hypertensive crisis, Hypertensive angiopathy, Pyrexia, Interstitial lung disease, Orthostatic hypertension, Organ failure, Drug ineffective, Vitamin A deficiency, Sarcopenic obesity, Body mass index increased\\\\n\\\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\"}]}'}"}, "time": 1706653964.6067157}
