ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

We need to carefully read the article snippet to identify any adverse reactions that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Favorable response to second-line atezolizumab and bevacizumab following progression on nivolumab in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: A case report demonstrating that anti-VEGF therapy overcomes resistance to checkpoint inhibition. ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a deadly disease in part due to decades of limited therapeutic options. With recent advances in our understanding of the tumor biology, several promising treatment strategies involving targeted and immunotherapies have emerged. However, enhancing their modest efficacy in HCC and other gastrointestinal malignancies is essential to improving survival. A man in his late 50s with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and morbid obesity initially presented with progressive abdominal pain and anorexia prompting an abdominal computed tomography scan that revealed a large solitary liver mass with extensive local involvement. Although there were features consistent with a primary gastric tumor on subsequent endoscopic evaluation leading to early diagnostic uncertainty, his clinical picture, including a dominant liver mass, immunohistochemical staining profile, and significantly elevated alpha fetoprotein ultimately favored HCC. METHODS The patient received palliative systemic therapy with infusional fluorouracil for a presumed gastric primary, however restaging scans after 3 cycles demonstrated disease progression. The consensus from a multidisciplinary discussion was that his pathology was more consistent with primary HCC. He was subsequently started on nivolumab with a partial response, although after 5 months, he progressed prompting initiation of second-line atezolizumab and bevacizumab with a favorable response. RESULTS The addition of atezolizumab and bevacizumab led to a sustained biochemical and radiographic response that appeared to overcome the resistance to nivolumab monotherapy. Aside from several mild immune-related adverse effects, his quality of life has greatly improved and he has tolerated treatment well to date. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor inhibition can overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibition in advanced HCC by resulting in a unique synergy that has never before been described in patients. The biological rationale for this response is likely attributable to the immunomodulatory effects of antiangiogenic agents, promoting an immunostimulatory microenvironment that can be exploited by immune checkpoint inhibitors for more effective antitumor activity. Given the considerable benefit patients may derive following progression on first-line treatment, it is important to consider this strategic combination of therapies which can ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes.
