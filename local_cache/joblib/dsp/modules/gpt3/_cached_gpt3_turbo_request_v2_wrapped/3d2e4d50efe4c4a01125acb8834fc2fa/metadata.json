ABSTRACT: The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC. Both patients were female. One patient had a confirmed diagnosis of PBC. The other patient had confirmed Sjogren syndrome and PBC. The two cases of PBC were infected with fungal infection after treatment with hormonal and immunosuppressive agents. RCR of sputum confirmed Pneumocystis spp. infection in the patient with PBC alone. The mucormycosis infection was confirmed in the other patient after pathological examination of a renal biopsy. The state of the illnesses progressed quickly and both patients ultimately succumbed to their conditions. The patient prognosis of fungal infection involvement PBC is poor. Patients treated with long-term hormone and immunosuppressive agents should be monitored. TEXT: Introduction Fungal infection has rarely been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC); however it may occur following live transplant (LT) in patients with PBC, predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection following LT include diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure and bacterial infection (1). The present study aimed to analyze the imaging, clinical and pathological features of fungal infection involvement in PBC by retrospectively analyzing and reviewing the features of two patients with fungal infection involvement in PBC who were admitted to our department.

The article discusses two cases of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) with fungal infection involvement. It mentions that fungal infections may occur following liver transplant in patients with PBC and lists predisposing factors for the development of fungal infection, including diabetes mellitus, cholestasis, hypertransfusion, acute rejection, treatment with high-dose steroids and immunosuppressive agents, renal failure, and bacterial infection. The article also specifically mentions that one patient had Pneumocystis spp. infection and the other had mucormycosis infection. Both patients succumbed to their conditions, indicating severe outcomes.\\\\n\\\\nReactions: Renal failure, Diabetes mellitus, Fungal infection, Bacterial infection, Mucormycosis, Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, Cholestasis, Immunosuppressant drug therapy, Transplant rejection, Respiratory failure\\\\n\\\\n---\\\\n\\\\nArticle: TITLE: Paroxetine overdose during pregnancy. ABSTRACT: Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. In some epidemiological studies, slightly increased risks of major malformations and cardiac malformations have been reported following paroxetine exposure in the first trimester of pregnancy. However, such findings have been inconsistent. There is only one report of any overdose of an SSRI during pregnancy, and that involved escitalopram. The aim of this case report was to describe the impact of a paroxetine overdose in the first trimester of pregnancy on the health of the foetus. A 21-year-old mother of one child who was pregnant with a second child was prescribed 20 mg/day paroxetine hydrochloride for the treatment of anxiety/depression. The patient ingested 15 or 16 20-mg tablets of paroxetine hydrochloride (300-320 mg) during the 5th week of pregnancy as a suicide attempt. Within 15 min of ingestion, she was admitted to hospital and treated for intoxication. No evidence of maternal SSRI intoxication was observed after treatment. The patient consulted our teratology information service for further risk assessment regarding possible major congenital malformations following the paroxetine overdose. We were unable to find previous reports of paroxetine overdose during pregnancy in the literature. The timely administration of the overdose treatment and the lack of maternal intoxication symptoms were considered positive for the foetal well-being, and the patient was referred for perinatology and psychiatry follow-ups. A healthy, 3 500-g male infant was born at 38 weeks\\' gestation, and his development at the age of 2 years was normal. This is the first reported case of paroxetine overdose during pregnancy. Comprehensive studies are needed to evaluate pregnancy outcomes after SSRI overdose.Key PointsThere are no reported data on paroxetine overdose during pregnancy.The aim of this case report was to describe the impact of a maternal paroxetine overdose in the first trimester of pregnancy on the health of the foetus. No evidence of maternal SSRI intoxication was observed.No congenital malformations or developmental disorders were observed in the child at 2 years of age.Comprehensive studies are needed to evaluate pregnancy outcomes following SSRI overdose.
