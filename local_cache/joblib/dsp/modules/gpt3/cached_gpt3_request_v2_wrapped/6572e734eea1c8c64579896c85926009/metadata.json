ABSTRACT: \u2022Small cell carcinoma of the ovary hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare neoplasm that mostly affects young women.\u2022The chances of future fertility in women are limited due to the aggressive nature of SCCOHT and need for adjuvant therapy.\u2022We report the case of a 26y woman with stage IA SCCOHT who had a successful pregnancy following surgery and chemotherapy. TEXT: 1 Introduction Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare neoplasm that mostly affects young women. Patients are usually diagnosed in their second or third decade of life, with a peak age between age 18 and 39 years (Young et al., 1994). The symptoms are usually nonspecific and include abdominal discomfort, pain or distension related to an abdominal or pelvic mass. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Regardless of disease stage, most patients relapse and die of disease. The estimated overall survival rate is 50% at one year and less than 10% at five years (Young et al., 1994). Several studies have reported familial cases of SCCOHT with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. It is associated with germline or somatic mutation in the SMARCA4 gene, which encodes the BRG1 protein. A recent study showed that even in patients with no family history of SCCOHT, up to half of those tested were found to carry a germline mutation (Witkowski, 2016). There is currently no standard protocol for treatment of SCCOHT and management remains a challenge. Previous studies have reported favorable results with a chemotherapy regimen consisting of vinblastine, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, bleomycin, adriamycin and etoposide (VPCBAE) as an adjuvant treatment after surgery (Senekjian et al., 1989, Callegaro-Filho et al., 2016). Other treatments showing activity in SCCOHT include other platinum-based chemotherapy regimens, high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant, radiation therapy and immunotherapy. Given the young age at diagnosis, many women with this disease desire preservation of fertility. There are limited data on fertility and pregnancy outcomes among women treated for SCCOHT. In this report, we present the case of a successful pregnancy following chemotherapy with VPCBAE. 2 Case presentation\\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to\", 'stop': ('\\n\\n',), 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1}"}, "time": 1706653012.395106}
